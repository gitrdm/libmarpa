# Russ Allbery recommends not installing his TAP
# harness, but copying it, and outlines how he does it
# in the "Using the Harness" section of his web page
# (https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/readme.html)
# Our procedure is based on Russ's.
# Our destination directory is cm_dist/tests.
#
# I would have prefered a choice in the matter, but the directory structure
# "tests/tap" is imposed by '#include' statements in Russ's code.
# We reserve tests for TAP tests only.
# If we have non-TAP tests in the future, we will create a sibling directory 
# to tests/ for them.
