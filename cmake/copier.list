# Russ Allbery recommends not installing his TAP
# harness, but copying it, and outlines how he does it
# in the "Using the Harness" section of his web page
# (https://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/software/c-tap-harness/readme.html)
# Our procedure is based on Russ's.
# Our destination directory is ac_dist/tests/tap, instead of his
# ac_dist/testss because we want to allow for non-TAP tests in
# the future.
#
# I would have prefered a choice in the matter, but the directory structure
# "tests/tap" is imposed by '#include' statements in Russ's code.
