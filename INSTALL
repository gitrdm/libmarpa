Libmarpa uses the GNU autoconf library for installation.  It tries to
avoid customization, sticking as close to the GNU "standard" as feasible.

This repository contains two distributions: the main distibution, with the
code; and another distribution containing the documentation.

To install either distribution, follow the instructions in the
README.INSTALL and/or INSTALL files at the top of the distribution
directory.

To create a tar file of the distribution directory for the main
distribution:

    make tar

To create a the distribution in the form of a directory, in the "dist/"
directory at the top level of this repository:

    make dist

To create a tar file of the distribution directory for the documentation
distribution:

    make doc_tar

To create a the distribution in the form of a directory, in the
"doc_dist/" directory at the top level of this repository:

    make doc_dist
