# Libmarpa Updates

## About this page

This is the updates page for Libmarpa,
which does not yet have a stable release.
It describes how to get support for Libmarpa.
When there is a stable release
this page will also contain

- descriptions of bugs in the latest stable release;
- notices which are useful to current users,
but which do not justify a full new stable distribution; and
- other information that we want to be able to update
without issuing a new stable release.

## Support

Bugs should be reported as issues in the
[Github repo](https://github.com/jeffreykegler/libmarpa).

For questions and other discussion,
the most active forum is the
`#marpa` IRC channel
on
[Libera.chat](https://libera.chat/).
There is also
[a Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/marpa-parser/).

## Bugs

As there has not yet been a stable release,
it is vacuously true that
there are no known bugs in the latest stable release.
