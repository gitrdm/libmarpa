=== Bumping version number

To bump version number, currently you must change the following files:

LIB_VERSION
work/ac/configure.ac
work/ac_doc/configure.ac
work/ac_doc1/configure.ac
work/public/marpa.h-version
cmake/CMakeLists.txt

=== Building under cmake

Do something like the following:

cd libmarpa_repo
make clean
make dists
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../libmarpa_repo/cm_dist
cmake --build .
