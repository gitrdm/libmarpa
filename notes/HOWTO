=== Bumping version number

To bump version number, change it in the top level Makefile,
do a "make clean", and then rebuild.

=== Building under cmake

Do something like the following:

cd libmarpa_repo
make clean
make dists
cd ..
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../libmarpa_repo/cm_dist
cmake --build .
