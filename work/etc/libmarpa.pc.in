# The libmarpa repo is intended, and this file is set up for, use by
# packaging developers, and therefore the ultimate installation destinations
# are unpredictable.  In the name of caution, the prefix variable is set
# to a relative location.  A downstream package using libmarpa is likely
# to want to modify this file to change the prefix variable.
#
# It is also possible to change the prefix value on the pkg-config
# command line using the "define-variable" option:
#
#   pkg-config --define-variable=prefix=/your/prefix --variable=includedir libmarpa
