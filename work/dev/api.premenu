@node Terms, definitions and notation
@chapter Terms, definitions and notation

The following definitions apply in this document:

@itemize
@item
@dfindex application
@dfn{application} means an ``application'' of Libmarpa.
In this document,
a Libmarpa application is not necessarily an application program.
For our purposes, an ``application''
might be another library that uses Libmarpa.
@item A
@dfindex value, boolean
@dfindex boolean
@dfindex boolean value
@dfn{boolean} value, or @dfn{boolean},
is an integer that is 0 or 1.
@item
@dfindex iff
@dfn{iff} abbreviates ``if and only if''.
@item
@dfindex max(x,y)
@code{max(x,y)} is the maximum of
@code{x} and @code{y},
where @code{x} and @code{y} are two numbers.
@item
@dfindex indeterminate value
An @dfn{indeterminate value}
is either an unspecified value or a trap value.
Our use of this term is consistent with its use in the C99 standard.
@item
@dfindex method
@dfn{Libmarpa method}, or just @dfn{method} means a C function
or a function-like macro of the Libmarpa library.
@item
@dfindex trap value
A @dfn{trap value},
also called a @dfn{trap representation},
is a value that when accessed causes undefined behavior.
Our use of this term is consistent with its use in the C99 standard.
@xref{Trap representations}
@item
@dfindex undefined behavior
An @dfn{undefined behavior}
is a behavior that this document does not specify.
One implication is that this behavior might be problematic.
Our use of this term is consistent with its use in the C99 standard.
@item
@dfindex unspecified behavior
An @dfn{unspecified behavior}
is a behavior that, within a range of possibilities,
is not further specified by this document.
This is usually not problematic.
Our use of this term is consistent with its use in the C99 standard.
@item
@dfindex unspecified value
An @dfn{unspecified value}
is a value on which this document imposes no restrictions,
except that it cannot be a trap value.
Our use of this term is consistent with its use in the C99 standard.
@item
@dfindex user
@dfn{User} means a ``user'' of the Libmarpa library.
A user of the library is also a programmer,
so that in this documents, ``user''
and ``programmer'' are essentially synonyms.
@item
@dfindex we
@dfindex us
@dfindex our
@dfn{We} (and ``us'' and ''our'') refer to the authors.
As of this writing, there is a primary author,
but the plural is traditional, and our ``we''
is intended to include the reader
and everyone
we are joining on the millenia-old voyage of discovery
into mathematics and language.
@end itemize

@node Application and diagnostic behavior
@section Application and diagnostic behavior

An
@dfindex application behavior
@dfindex behavior, application
@dfn{application behavior}
is a behavior on which it is intended that
the design of applications
will be based.
In this document,
a behavior is an application behavior unless otherwise stated.
Most of the behaviors specified in this document are application
behaviors.
We sometimes say that ``applications may expect'' a certain behavior
to emphasize that that behavior is an application behavior.

After an irrecoverable failure, the behavior of a Libmarpa application
is undefined,
so that there are no behaviors that can be relied on for normal
application processing,
and therefore, there are no application behaviors.
In this circumstance,
some of the application behaviors become
diagnostic behaviors.
A
@dfindex diagnostic behavior
@dfindex behavior, diagnostic
@dfn{diagnostic behavior}
is a behavior that this document suggests
that the programmer may attempt in the face of an irrecoverable failure,
for purpose of testing, diagnostics and debugging.
Diagnostic behaviors are hoped for, rather than expected,
and intended
to allow the programmer to deal with irrecoverable
failures as smoothly as possible.
(@xref{Failure}.)

In this document,
a behavior is a diagnostic behavior only if that is specifically
indicated.
Applications should not be designed to rely
on diagnostic behaviors.
We sometimes say that ``diagnostics may attempt'' a certain behavior
to emphasize that that behavior is a diagnostic behavior.

@node About Libmarpa
@chapter About Libmarpa

Libmarpa implements the Marpa parsing algorithm.
Marpa is named
after the legendary 11th century Tibetan translator,
Marpa Lotsawa.
In creating Marpa,
I depended heavily on previous work by Jay Earley,
Joop Leo,
John Aycock and Nigel Horspool.

Libmarpa implements the entire Marpa algorithm.
This library does
the necessary grammar preprocessing, recognizes the input,
and produces parse trees.
It also supports the ordering, iteration
and evaluation of the parse
trees.

Libmarpa is very low-level.
For example, it has no strings.
Rules, symbols, and token values are all represented
by integers.
This, of course, will not suffice for many applications.
Users will very often want
names for the symbols, non-integer values for
tokens, or both.
Typically, applications will use arrays to
translate Libmarpa's integer ID's to strings or other
values as required.

Libmarpa also does @strong{not} implement most of the semantics.
Libmarpa does have an evaluator (called a ``valuator''),
but it does @strong{not}
manipulate the stack directly.
Instead, Libmarpa,
based on its traversal of the parse tree,
passes optimized step by step stack manipulation
instructions to the upper layer.
These instructions indicate the token or rule involved,
and the proper location for the true token value or
the result of the rule evaluation.
For rule evaluations, the instructions include the stack location
of the arguments.

Marpa requires most semantics to be
implemented in the application.
This allows the application total flexibility.
It also puts
the application is in a much better position to prevent errors,
to catch errors at runtime or,
failing all else,
to successfully debug the logic.

@node Architecture
@chapter Architecture

@node Major objects
@section Major objects

The classes of
Libmarpa's object system fall into two types:
major and numbered.
These are the Libmarpa's major classes,
in sequence.

@itemize
@item
Configuration:
A configuration object is
a thread-safe way to hold configuration variables,
as well as the return code from failed attempts
to create grammar objects.
@item
Grammar:
A grammar object contains rules and symbols,
with their properties.
@item
Recognizer:
A recognizer object reads input.
@item
Bocage:
A bocage object is a collection of
parse trees, as found by a recognizer.
Bocages are similar to parse forests.
@item
Ordering:
An ordering object
is an ordering of the trees
in a bocage.
@item
Tree:
A tree object is a bocage iterator.
@item
Value:
A value object is a tree iterator.
Iteration of tree using a value object
produces ``steps''.
These ``steps'' are
instructions to
the application on how
to evaluate the semantics,
and how to manipulate the stack.
@end itemize


The major objects have one letter abbreviations,
which are used frequently.
These are, in the standard sequence,

@itemize
@item
Configuration:  C
@item
Grammar:  G
@item
Recognizer: R
@item
Bocage: B
@item
Ordering: O
@item
Tree: T
@item
Value: V
@end itemize

@node Time objects
@section Time objects

All of Libmarpa's major classes,
except the configuration class,
are ``time'' classes.
Except for objects in the grammar class,
all time objects are created from another time
object.
Each time object is created from a time object
of the class before it in the sequence.
A recognizer cannot be created without a precomputed grammar;
a bocage cannot be created without a recognizer;
and so on.

When one time object is used to create a second
time object,
the first time object is the
@dfindex @sortas{parent object} parent object (of a time object)
@dfn{parent object}
and the second time object is the
@dfindex @sortas{child object} child object (of a time object)
@dfn{child object}.
For example, when a bocage is created from a
recognizer,
the recognizer is the parent object,
and the bocage is the child object.

Grammars have no parent object.
Every other time object has exactly one parent object.
Value objects have no child objects.
All other time objects can have any number of children,
from zero up to
some machine-determined limit,
such as memory.

An object is the
@dfindex ancestor (object)
@dfn{ancestor}
of another object if it is the parent of
that object,
or if it is the parent of an ancestor of that object.
An object is the
@dfindex descendant (object)
@dfn{descendant}
of another object if it is the child of
that object,
or if it is the child of an descendant of that object.
The following three statements are mutually exclusive:
@itemize
@item Object @code{X} is of class @code{C}.
@item Object @code{X} has an ancestor of class @code{C}.
@item Object @code{X} has a descendant of class @code{C}.
@end itemize
It follows from the definitions of "parent" and "ancestor" that,
for any time object class, an
object can have at most one ancestor of that class.
On the other hand, if an object has descendants in a class,
there can be many of them.

An object is a
@dfindex base (object)
@dfn{base}
of another object, if it is that object,
or if it is the ancestor of the object.
For each time object class, an object has at most one base object.
For example, a recognizer is its own base recognizer,
and has exactly one base grammar.

The
@dfindex @sortas{base grammar} base grammar (of a time object)
@dfn{base grammar}
of a time object is of special importance.
Every time object has a base grammar.
A grammar object is its own base grammar.
The base grammar of a recognizer is its parent grammar,
the one that it was created with.
The base grammar of any other time object is the base
grammar of its parent object.
For example,
the base grammar of a bocage is the base
grammar of the recognizer that it was created
with.

@node Reference counting
@section Reference counting

Every object in a ``time'' class
has its own, distinct, lifetime,
which is controlled by the object's reference count.
Reference counting follows the usual practice.
Contexts that take a share of the
``ownership'' of an object
increase the reference count by 1.
When a context relinquishes its share of
the ownership of an object, it decreases the reference
count by 1.

Each class of time object has a ``ref'' and an ``unref''
method, to be used by those contexts that need to
explicitly increment and decrement the reference count.
For example, the ``ref'' method for the grammar class is
@code{marpa_g_ref()}
and the ``unref'' method for the grammar class is
@code{marpa_g_unref()}.

Time objects do not have explicit destructors.
When the reference count of a time object reaches
0, that time object is destroyed.

Much of the necessary reference counting
is performed automatically.
The context calling the constructor of a time object
does not need to explicitly increase the reference
count, because
Libmarpa time objects are
always created with a reference count of 1.

Child objects ``own'' their parents,
and when a child object is successfully created,
the reference count of its parent object is
automatically incremented to reflect this.
When a child object is destroyed, it
automatically decrements the reference count of its parent.

In a typical application, a calling context needs only
to remember
to ``unref'' each time object that it creates,
once it is finished with that time object.
All other reference decrements and increments are taken
care of automatically.
The typical application never needs to explicitly
call one of the ``ref'' methods.

More complex applications may find it convenient
to have one or more contexts share ownership of objects
created in another context.
These more complex situations
are the only cases in which the ``ref'' methods
will be needed.

@node Numbered objects
@section Numbered objects

In addition to its major, ``time'' objects, Libmarpa also has
numbered objects.
Numbered objects do not have lifetimes of their own.
Every numbered object belongs to a time object,
and is destroyed with it.
Rules and symbols are numbered objects.
Tokens values are another class of numbered
objects.

@node Input
@chapter Input

@node Earlemes
@section Earlemes

@node The traditional input model
@subsection The traditional input model

In traditional Earley parsers, the concept of location is very simple.
Locations are numbered from 0 to @var{n}, where @var{n} is the length of
the input.
Every location has an Earley set, and vice versa.
Location 0 is the start location.
Every location after the start location has exactly one input token
associated with it.

Some applications
do not fit this traditional input model ---
natural language processing requires ambiguous tokens,
for example.
Libmarpa allows a wide variety of alternative input models.

In Libmarpa a location is called a
@dfindex earleme
@dfn{earleme}.
The number of an Earley set is the
@dfindex ID (of an Earley set)
@dfn{ID of the Earley set},
or its
@dfindex ordinal (of an Earley set)
@dfn{ordinal}.
In the traditional model, the ordinal of an Earley set and
its earleme are always exactly the same, but in Libmarpa's
advanced input models
the ordinal of an Earley set can be different from
its location (earleme).

The important earleme values are
the latest earleme.
the current earleme, and
the furthest earleme.
Latest, current and furthest earleme,
when they have specified values,
obey a lexical order in this sense:
The latest earleme is always at or before the current earleme,
and the current earleme is always at or before the furthest earleme.

@node The latest earleme
@subsection The latest earleme

The
@dfindex Earley set, latest
@dfn{latest Earley set}
is the Earley set completed most recently.
This is initially the Earley set at location 0.
The latest Earley set is always the Earley set with the highest ordinal,
and the Earley set with the highest earleme location.
The
@dfindex earleme, latest
@dfn{latest earleme} is the earleme of the latest Earley set.
If there is an Earley set at the current earleme,
it is the latest Earley set and the latest earleme
is equal to the current earleme.
There is never an Earley set after the current earleme,
and therefore the latest Earley set is never after the
current earleme.
The @code{marpa_r_start input()} and
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} methods
are only ones that change the latest earleme.
@xref{marpa_r_start_input, marpa_r_start_input()}, and
@ref{marpa_r_earleme_complete, marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.

The latest earleme is different from the current earleme if and only if
there is no Earley set at the current earleme.
A different end of parsing can be specified,
but by default, parsing is of the input
in the range
from earleme 0 to the latest earleme.

@node The current earleme
@subsection The current earleme

The
@dfindex earleme, current
@dfn{current earleme}
is the earleme that Libmarpa is currently working on.
More specifically, it is the one at which new tokens will @strong{start}.
Since tokens are never zero length, a new token will always end after the
current earleme.
@code{marpa_r_start_input()}
initializes the current earleme to 0,
and every call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
advances the
current earleme by 1.
The @code{marpa_r_start input()} and
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} methods
are only ones that change the current earleme.
@xref{marpa_r_start_input, marpa_r_start_input()}, and
@ref{marpa_r_earleme_complete, marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.

@node The furthest earleme
@subsection The furthest earleme

Loosely speaking,
the
@dfindex earleme, furthest
@dfn{furthest earleme}
is the furthest earleme reached by the parse.
More precisely,
it is the highest numbered
earleme at which a token ends
and is 0 if there are no tokens.
The furthest earleme is 0 when a recognizer is
created.
With every call to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}, the end of the token
it adds is calculated.
A token ends at the earleme location @var{current}+@var{length},
where @var{current} is the current earleme,
and @var{length} is the length of the newly added token.
If @code{old_f} is the furthest earleme before
a call to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()},
the furthest earleme after the call
is @code{max(old_f, current+length)}.
The @code{marpa_r_new()} and
@code{marpa_r_alternative()} methods
are only ones that change the furthest earleme.
@xref{marpa_r_new, marpa_r_new()}, and
@ref{marpa_r_alternative, marpa_r_alternative()}.

In the basic input models,
where every token has length 1,
calling
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
after each
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
call is sufficient to process
all inputs,
and the furthest earleme's value
can be typically be ignored.
In alternative input models,
where tokens have lengths greater than 1,
calling @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
once after the last token
is read may not be enough to ensure that all tokens have been processed.
To ensure that all tokens have been processed,
an application must advance the current earleme
by calling
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
until the current earleme is equal to the furthest earleme.

@node The basic models of input
@section The basic models of input

For the purposes of presentation,
we (somewhat arbitrarily)
divide Libmarpa's input models
into two groups:
basic and advanced.
In the
@dfindex basic models of input
@dfindex models of input, basic
@dfindex input, basic models of
@dfn{basic input models of input},
every token is exactly one earleme long.
This implies that, in a basic model of input,
@itemize
@item every token is the same length,
@item the ordinal of an Earley set
will always be the same as its earleme location, and
@item the latest earleme and the current earleme are always equal.
@end itemize

In the
@dfindex advanced models of input
@dfindex models of input, advanced
@dfindex input, advanced models of
@dfn{advanced models of input},
tokens may have a length other than 1.
Most applications use the basic input models.
The details of the advanced models of input are
presented in a later chapter.
@xref{Advanced input models}.

@node The standard model of input
@subsection The standard model of input

In the standard model of input,
there is exactly one successful
@code{marpa_r_alternative()} call
immediately previous
to every
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call.
A @code{marpa_r_alternative()} call is
@dfindex previous (to a @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call), immediately
@dfindex immediately previous (to a @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call)
@dfn{immediately previous} to a
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call
iff
that @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call is
the first
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call after
the @code{marpa_r_alternative()} call.

Recall that, since the standard model is
a basic model,
the token length in every successful call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
will be one.
For an input of length @var{n}, there will be
exactly @var{n} @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} calls,
and all but the last call
to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
must be successful.

In the standard model,
after a successful call
to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()},
if @var{c} is the value  of the current earleme before the call,
@itemize
@item the current earleme will remain unchanged and therefore
  will be @var{c}; and
@item the furthest earleme be @var{c}+1.
@end itemize

In the standard model,
a call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
follows a successful call of
@code{marpa_r_alternative()},
so that the value of the furthest earleme before the call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} will be @code{c+1},
where @var{c} is the value of the current earleme.
After a successful call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
@itemize
@item the current earleme will be advanced to @code{c+1}; and
@item the furthest earleme will be @var{c+1}, and therefore equal
to the current earleme.
@end itemize

Recall that, in the basic models of input,
the latest earleme is always equal to the current earleme.

@node Ambiguous input
@subsection Ambiguous input

We can loosen the standard model to
allow more than one successful call to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
immediately previous to each call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
This change will mean that multiple tokens become possible
at each earleme ---
in other words, that the input becomes ambiguous.
We continue to require that there be
at least one successful call to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
before each call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
And we recall that,
since this is a basic input model,
all tokens must have a length of 1.

In the ambiguous input model, the behavior of the current,
latest and furthest earlemes are exactly
as described for the standard model.
@xref{The standard model of input}.

@node Terminals
@section Terminals

A terminal symbol is a symbol that
may appear in the input.
Traditionally,
all LHS symbols, as well as
the start symbol, must be non-terminals.
This is Marpa's behavior, by default.

Marpa allows the user to eliminate the distinction
between terminals and non-terminals.
In this, it
differs from traditional parsers.
Libmarpa
can arrange for a terminal
to appear on the LHS of one or more rules,
or for a terminal to be the start symbol.
However,
since terminals can never be zero length,
it is a logical contradiction for a nulling
symbol to also be a terminal
and Marpa does not allow it.

Token values are @code{int}'s.
Libmarpa does nothing with token values except accept
them from the application and return them during
parse evaluation.

@node Exhaustion
@chapter Exhaustion

A parse is
@dfindex exhausted parse
@dfindex parse, exhausted
@dfn{exhausted} when it cannot accept any further input.
A parse is
@dfindex active parse
@dfindex parse, active
@dfn{active} iff it is not exhausted.
For a parse to be exhausted,
the furthest earleme and the current earleme
must be equal.
However, the converse is not always the case:
if more tokens can be read at the current earleme,
then it is possible for
the furthest earleme and the current earleme
to be equal in an active parse.

Parse exhaustion always has a location.
That is, if a parse is exhausted it is exhausted at some earleme location @code{X}.
If a parse is exhausted at location @code{X}, then
@itemize
@item There may be valid parses at @code{X}.
@item The parse was active at all locations earlier than @code{X}.
@item There may be valid parses at locations before @code{X}.
@item There will be no valid parses at locations after @code{X}.
@item No tokens can start at location @code{X}.
@item No tokens can end at a location after @code{X}.
@item No tokens can start at any location after @code{X}.
@item No tokens will be accepted by an exhausted parser.
    It is an irrecoverable hard failure to call @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
    after a parser has become exhausted.
@item No Earley sets will be at any location after @code{X}.
@item No earlemes are completed by, and no Earley sets are created by, an exhausted parser.
    It is an irrecoverable hard failure to call @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
    after a parser has become exhausted.
@end itemize

Users sometimes assume that parse exhaustion means parse failure.
But other users sometimes assume that parse exhaustion means parse success.
For many grammars,
there are strong associations between parse exhaustion
and parse success,
but the strong association can go either way,
Both exhaustion-loving and exhaustion-hating
grammars are very common in
practical application.

In an
@dfindex exhaustion-hating applications
@dfindex applications, exhaustion-hating
@dfn{exhaustion-hating}
application,
parse exhaustion typically means parse failure.
C programs, Perl scripts and most programming languages
are exhaustion-hating applications.
If a C program is well-formed,
it is always possible to read more input.
The same is true of a Perl program that does not have a @code{__DATA__} section.

In an
@dfindex exhaustion-loving applications
@dfindex applications, exhaustion-loving
@dfn{exhaustion-loving}
application
parse exhaustion means parse success.
A toy example of an exhaustion-loving
application is the language consisting of balanced parentheses.
When the parentheses come into perfect balance the parse is exhausted,
because any further input would unbalance the brackets.
And the parse succeeds when the parentheses come into perfect balance.
Exhaustion means success.
Any language that balances start and end indicators will tend to
be exhaustion-loving.
HTML and XML, with their start and end tags, can be seen
as exhaustion-loving languages.

One common form of exhaustion-loving parsing
occurs in lexers that look for longest matches.
Exhaustion will indicate that the longest match has been found.

It is possible for a language to be
exhaustion-loving at some points
and exhaustion-hating at others.
We mentioned Perl's @code{__DATA__} as a complication in a
basically exhaustion-hating language.

@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} and
@code{marpa_r_start_input} are the only methods
that may encounter parse exhaustion.
@xref{marpa_r_earleme_complete,marpa_r_earleme_complete()}, and
@ref{marpa_r_start_input,marpa_r_start_input()}.
When the @code{marpa_r_start_input} or
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} methods
exhaust the parse,
they generate a @code{MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED} event.
Applications
can also query
parse exhaustion status directly
with the
@code{marpa_r_is_exhausted()} method.
@xref{marpa_r_is_exhausted,marpa_r_is_exhausted()}.

@node Semantics
@chapter Semantics

Libmarpa handling of semantics is unusual.
Most semantics are left up to the application,
but Libmarpa guides them.
Specifically, the application is expected to maintain the evaluation
stack.
Libmarpa's valuator provides instructions on how to handle the stack.
Libmarpa's stack handling instructions
are called ``steps''.
For example, a Libmarpa step might tell the application that the value
of a token needs to go into a certain stack position.
Or a Libmarpa step might tell the application that a rule is to be evaluated.
For rule evalution, Libmarpa will tell the application where the operands
are to be found,
and where the result must go.

The detailed discussion of
Libmarpa's handling of semantics is in the reference chapters
of this document,
under the appropriate methods and classes.
The most extensive discussion of the semantics
is in the section that deals with the methods of the value time class
(@ref{Value methods}).

@node Threads
@chapter Threads

Libmarpa is thread-safe,
given circumstances as described below.
The Libmarpa methods are not reentrant.

Libmarpa is C89-compliant.
It uses no global data,
and calls only the routines
that are defined in the C89 standard
and that can be made thread-safe.
In most modern implementations,
the default C89 implementation is thread-safe
to the extent possible.
But the C89 standard does not require thread-safety,
and even most modern environments allow the user
to turn thread safety off.
To be thread-safe, Libmarpa must be compiled
and linked in an environment that provides
thread-safety.

While Libmarpa can be used safely across
multiple threads,
a Libmarpa grammar cannot be.
Further, a Libmarpa time object can
only be used safely in the same thread
as its base grammar.
This is because all
time objects with the same base grammar share data
from that base grammar.

To work around this limitation,
the same grammar definition can be
used to a create a new
Libmarpa grammar
time object in each thread.
If there is sufficient interest, future versions of
Libmarpa could allow thread-safe
cloning of grammars and other
time objects.

@node Libmarpa's approach to failure
@section Libmarpa's approach to failure

Libmarpa is a C language library,
and inherits the traditional C language approach to
avoiding and handling user programming errors.
This approach will strike readers unfamiliar with this
tradition as putting an appallingly large
portion of the burden of avoiding application
programmer error
on the application programmer themself.

But in the early 1970's, when the C language first stabilized,
the alternative,
and the consensus choice for its target applications
was assembly language.
In that context, C was radical in its willingness to
incur a price in efficiency in order to protect the programmer
from themself.
C was considered to take a excessively "hand holding"
approach which very much flew in the face of consensus.

The decades have made a large difference in the trade-offs,
and the consensus about the degree to which even a
low-level language should protect the user has changed.
It seems inevitable that C will be replaced as the low-level
language of choice, by a language that places
fewer burdens on the programmer,
and more on the machine.
The question seems to be not whether C will be dethroned
as the ``go to'' language for low-level progamming,
but when, and by which alternative.

Modern hardware makes many simple checks essentially cost-free,
and Libmarpa's efforts to protect the application programmer go well
beyond what
would have been considered best practice in the past.
But it remains a C language library.
But, on the whole, the Libmarpa application programmer must be prepared to exercise
the high degree of carefulness traditionally required by its C language environment.
Libmarpa
places the burden of avoiding irrecoverable failures,
and of handling recoverable failures,
largely on the application programmer.

@node User non-conformity to specified behavior
@section User non-conformity to specified behavior

This document specifies many behaviors
for Libmarpa application programs to follow,
such as the nature of the arguments to each method.
The C language environment specifies
many more behaviors,
such as proper memory management.
When a non-conformity to specified behavior is unintentional
and problematic,
it is frequently called a ``bug''.
Even the most carefully programmed Libmarpa application may sometimes
contain a ``bug''.
In addition, some specified behaviors are explicitly stated as characterizing
a primary branch of the processing,
rather than made mandatory for all successful processing.
Non-conformity to non-mandatory behaviors can be efficiently recoverable,
and is often intentional.

This chapter describes how
non-conformity to specified behavior
by a Libmarpa application
is handled by Libmarpa.
Non-conformity to specified behavior
by a Libmarpa application
is also called, for the purposes of this document,
a
@dfindex Libmarpa application programming failure
@dfindex failure, Libmarpa application programming
@dfindex failure
@dfn{Libmarpa application programming failure}.
In contexts where no ambiguity arises,
@dfn{Libmarpa application programming failure}
will
usually be abbreviated to
@dfn{failure}.

@dfindex Libmarpa application programming success
@dfindex success, Libmarpa application programming
@dfindex success
@dfn{Libmarpa application programming success}
in a context
is defined as the absence of unrecovered failure in that context.
When no ambiguity arises,
@dfn{Libmarpa application programming success}
is almost
always abbreviated to
@dfn{success}.
For example, the success of an application means the application
ran without any irrecoverable failures,
and that it recovered from all the recoverable failures that were detected.

@node Classifying failure
@section Classifying failure

A Libmarpa application programming failure,
unless stated otherwise,
is an irrecoverable failure.
Once an irrecoverable failure has occurred,
the further behavior of the program is undefined.
Nonetheless, we specify,
and Libmarpa attempts,
diagnostics behaviors
(@pxref{Application and diagnostic behavior})
in an effort to handle irrecoverable failures as
smoothly as possible.

A Libmarpa application programming failure
is not recoverable,
unless this document states otherwise.

@c So far all recoverable failures are trivially recoverable,
@c Wait and set and determine what to do with the following
@c
@c Every recoverable failure has
@c @dfindex recovery handling
@c @dfn{recovery handling}
@c associated with it.
@c The recovery handling is the processing necessary
@c for the application to recover from a recoverable failure.

@c
@c The recovery handling is

@c we say that the failure is
@c trivially recoverable.
@c A
@c @dfindex trivially recoverable failure

@c @dfn{trivially recoverable failure}
@c is recovered from

@c and proceed immediately with normal processing.

A failure is called a
@dfindex hard failure
@dfindex failure, hard
@dfn{hard failure}
is it has an error code
associated with it.
A recoverable failure is called a
@dfindex soft failure
@dfindex failure, soft
@dfn{soft failure}
if it has no associated error code.
(For more on error codes, see @ref{Error codes}.)

All failures fall into one of five types.
In order of severity, these are
@itemize
@item @strong{memory allocation failures},
@item @strong{undetected failures},
@item @strong{irrecoverable hard failures},
@item @strong{partially recoverable hard failures}, and
@item @strong{fully recoverable hard failures}, and

@node Memory allocation failure
@section Memory allocation failure

Failure to allocate memory is the most irrecoverable of irrecoverable
errors.
Even effective error handling assumes the ability to allocate memory,
so that the practice has been, in the event of a memory allocation failure,
to take Draconian action.
On
@dfindex memory allocation failur
@dfindex failure, memory allocation
@dfn{memory allocation failure},
as with all irrecoverable failures,
Libmarpa's behavior in undefined,
but Libmarpa attempts to terminate the current program abnormally by calling @code{abort()}.

Memory allocation failure is the only case in which Libmarpa
terminates the program.
In all other cases,
Libmarpa leaves the decision to terminate the program,
whether normally or abnormally,
up to the application programmer.

Memory allocation failure does not have an error code.
As a pedantic matter, memory allocation failure
is neither a hard or a soft failure.

@node Undetected failure
@section Undetected failure

An
@dfindex undetected failure
@dfindex failure, undetected
@dfn{undetected failure} is a failure that the Libmarpa
library does not detect.
Many failures are impossible or impractical
for a C library to detect.
Two examples of failure that the Libmarpa methods do not detect
are writes outside the bounds of allocated memory,
and use of memory after it has been freed.
C is not strongly typed, and arguments
of Libmarpa routines undergo only a few simple tests,
tests which are inadequate to detect many of the potential problems.

By undetected failure we emphasize that we mean failures undetected
@strong{by the Libmarpa methods}.
In the examples just given,
there exist tools that can help the programmer
detect memory errors
and other tools exist
to check the sanity of method arguments.

This document points out some of the potentially undetected problems,
when doing so seems more helpful than tedious.
But any attempt to list all the undetected problems would be too large
and unwieldy to be useful.

Undetected failure is always irrecoverable.
An undetected failure
is neither a hard or a soft failure.

@node Irrecoverable hard failure
@section Irrecoverable hard failure

An
@dfindex irrecoverable hard failure
@dfindex hard failure, irrecoverable
@dfindex failure, irrecoverable hard
@dfn{irrecoverable hard failure}
is
an irrecoverable Libmarpa application programming failure that has an
error code associated with it.
Libmarpa attempts to behave as predictably as possible
in the face of a hard failure,
but once an irrecoverable failure occurs,
the behavior of a Libmarpa application is undefined.

In the event of an irrecoverable failure,
there are no application behaviors.
The diagnostic behavior for a hard failure is as described
for the method that detects the hard failure.
At a minimum, this diagnostic behavior will be returning from
the method that detects the hard failure with the return
value specified for hard failure,
and setting the error code as specified for hard failure.

@node Partially recoverable hard failure

@item after which some, but not all, of the
    application behaviors remain available to the programmer.
@end itemize
For every partially recoverable hard failure,
this document specifies the application behaviors that remain
available after it occurs.
The most common kind of
partially recoverable hard failure is a
library-recoverable hard failure.
For an example of
partially recoverable hard failure,
@pxref{Library-recoverable hard failure}.

@node Library-recoverable hard failure
@section Library-recoverable hard failure

A
@dfindex library-recoverable hard failure
@dfindex hard failure, library-recoverable
@dfindex failure, library-recoverable hard
@dfn{library-recoverable hard failure}
is a type of partially recoverable hard failure.
Loosely described, it is a hard failure that
allows the programmer to continue to use many
of the Libmarpa methods in the library,
but that disallows certain methods on  some objects.

To state the restrictions of application behaviors
more precisely, let
the ``failure grammar'' be the base grammar
of the method that detected the library-recoverable hard failure.
After a library-recoverable hard failure,
the following behaviors are no longer applcation
behaviors:
@itemize
@item Libmarpa mutator and constructor method calls where the base grammar is the
  failure grammar.
@end itemize
Recall that any use of a behavior that is not an application
behavior is an irrecoverable failure.

The application behaviors
remaining after a library-recoverable hard failure
are the following:
@itemize
@item All non-Libmarpa interfaces, including calls to other libraries
and the C language environment.
@item All Libmarpa static method calls.
@item All Libmarpa accessor and destructor method calls.
@item All Libmarpa mutator and constructor method calls
whose base grammar is not the failure grammar.
@end itemize

Note that Libmarpa destructors remain available after
a library recoverable failure.
An application will often want to destroy all Libmarpa objects
whose base grammar is the failure grammar,
in order to clear memory of problematic objects.

An example of a library-recoverable hard failure is
the @code{MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE} error
in the @code{marpa_g_precompute} method.
@xref{marpa_g_precompute,marpa_g_precompute()}.

@node Ancestry-recoverable hard failure
@section Ancestry-recoverable hard failure

An
@dfindex ancestry-recoverable hard failure
@dfindex hard failure, ancestry-recoverable
@dfindex failure, ancestry-recoverable hard
@dfn{ancestry-recoverable hard failure}
is a type of partially recoverable hard failure.
An ancestry-recoverable failure allows a superset of the application behaviors
allowed by a library-recoverable hard failure.
More precisely, let
the ``failure object'' be the object that detected
the ancestry-recoverable hard failure.
After an ancestry-recoverable hard failure,
the following behaviors are no longer applcation
behaviors:
@itemize
@item Libmarpa mutator and constructor method calls where the object is the
  failure object, or one of its descendants.
@end itemize
Recall that any use of a behavior that is not an application
behavior is an irrecoverable failure.

The application behaviors
remaining after a ancestry-recoverable hard failure
are the following:
@itemize
@item All non-Libmarpa interfaces, including calls to other libraries
and the C language environment.
@item All Libmarpa static method calls.
@item All Libmarpa accessor and destructor method calls.
@item All Libmarpa mutator and constructor method calls
for time objects that are not the failure object,
or one of its descendants.
@end itemize

Note that all Libmarpa destructors remain available after
an ancestry-recoverable failure.
An application will often want to destroy the failure object
and all of its descendants,
in order to clear memory of problematic objects.

As an example,
users calling @code{marpa_g_precompute()}
will often want to treat a @code{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD} event
as if it were an ancestry-recoverable hard failure.
@xref{marpa_g_precompute,marpa_g_precompute()}.

Library-recoverable failure is a special case of ancestry-recoverable
failure.
When the failure object is a grammar,
ancestry-recoverable failure is synonymous with
library-recoverable failure.

@node Fully recoverable hard failure
@section Fully recoverable hard failure

A
@dfindex fully recoverable hard failure
@dfindex hard failure, fully recoverable
@dfindex failure, fully recoverable hard
@dfn{fully recoverable hard failure}
is
a recoverable Libmarpa application programming failure
@itemize
@item that has an error code associated with it; and
@item after which all of the
    application behaviors remain available to the programmer.
@end itemize
One example of a fully recoverable hard failure is
the error code @code{MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID}.
The ``Ruby Slippers'' parsing technique
(@pxref{Ruby Slippers}),
which has seen extensive usage,
is based
on Libmarpa's ability to recover from
a @code{MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID} error
fully and efficiently,

@node Soft failure
@section Soft failure

An
@dfindex soft failure
@dfindex failure, soft
@dfn{soft failure}
is
an recoverable Libmarpa application programming failure that has no
error code associated with it.
Hard errors are assigned error codes in order to tell them apart.
Error codes are not necessary or useful for soft errors,
because there is at most one type of soft failure per Libmarpa method.

@dfn{Soft failures}
are so called,
because they are the least severe kind of failure.
The most severe failures are ``bugs'' ---
unintended, and a symptom of a problem.
Soft failures, on the other hand, are a frequent occurrence
in normal, successful, processing.
In the phrase ``soft failure'', the word ``failure'' is used
in the same sense that its cognate ``fail'' is used
when we say that a loop terminates when it ``fails'' its
loop condition.
That ''failure'' is of a condition necessary to continue on
a main branch of processing, and a signal to proceed on another branch.

It is expected that Libmarpa applications will be designed
such that successful execution
is based on the handling specified for soft failures.
In fact, a non-trival Libmarpa application can hardly be designed
except on that basis.

@node Error codes
@section Error codes

As stated, every hard failure has an associated error code.
Full descriptions of the error codes
that are returned by the external methods
are given in their own section
(@ref{External error codes}).

How the error code is accessed depends on the method
that detects the hard failure associated with that error code.
Methods for time objects always set the error code in the base grammar,
from which it may be accessed using the error methods described below
(@ref{Error methods}).
If a method has no base grammar,
the way in which the error code for the hard failures that it detects
can be accessed will be stated in the
description of that method.

Since the error of a time object is set in the base grammar,
it follows that every object with the same base grammar
has the same error code.
Objects with different base grammars may have different error codes.

While error codes are properties of a base grammar,
irrecoverability is application-wide.
That is, whenever any irrecoverable failure occurs, the entire
application is irrecoverable.
Once an application becomes irrecoverable,
those Libmarpa objects with error codes for recoverable errors
are still subject to the general irrecoverability.

@node Introduction to the method descriptions
@chapter Introduction to the method descriptions

The following chapters describe Libmarpa's methods
in detail.

@node About the overviews
@section  About the overviews

The method descriptions are grouped into chapters and sections.
Each such group of methods descriptions begins, optionally, with an overview.
These overviews, again optionally, end with a ``cheat sheet''.
The ``cheat sheets'' name the
most important Libmarpa methods in that chapter
or section,
in the order in which they are typically used,
and very briefly describe their purpose.

The overviews sometimes speak of
an ``archetypal'' application.
The
@dfindex archetypal Libmarpa application
@dfindex Libmarpa application, archetypal
@dfn{archetypal Libmarpa application}
implements a complete logic flow,
starting with the creation of a grammar,
and proceeding all the way
to the return of the final result from a value object.
In the archetypal Libmarpa application,
the grammar, input and semantics are
all small but non-trivial.

@node Naming conventions
@section Naming conventions

Methods in Libmarpa follow a strict naming convention.
All methods have a name beginning with
@code{marpa_},
if they are part of the
external interface.
If an external method is not a static method,
its name is prefixed with one of
@code{marpa_c_},
@code{marpa_g_},
@code{marpa_r_},
@code{marpa_b_},
@code{marpa_o_},
@code{marpa_t_} or
@code{marpa_v_},
where the single letter between underscores
is one of the Libmarpa major class abbreviations.
The letter indicates which class
the method belongs to.

Methods that are exported,
but that are part of
the internal interface,
begin with @code{_marpa_}.
Methods that are part of the internal interface
(often called ``internal methods'')
are subject to change and are intended for use
only by Libmarpa's developers.

Libmarpa reserves the
@code{marpa_}
and @code{_marpa_} prefixes for itself,
with all their capitalization variants.
All Libmarpa names visible outside the package
will begin with a capitalization variant
of one of these two prefixes.

@node Return values
@section Return values

Some general conventions for return values are worth
mentioning:
@itemize
@item For methods that return an integer,
a return value of @minus{}1
usually indicates soft method failure.
@item For methods that return an integer,
a return value of @minus{}2
usually indicates hard method failure.
@item For methods that return an integer,
a return value greater of zero or more usually indicates method success.
@item If a method returns an pointer value,
@code{NULL} usually indicates method failure.
Any other result usually indicates method success.
@end itemize

The words ``success'' and ``failure'' are heavily overloaded
in these documents.
But in contexts where our meaning is clear we will usually
abbreviate ``method success'' and ``method failure'' to
``success'' and ``failure'', respectively.


The Libmarpa programmer should not overly rely on the general
conventions for return values.
In particular, @minus{}2 may sometimes be ambiguous ---
both a valid return value
for method success, and a potential indication of hard method failure.
In this case, the programmer must distinguish the two return statuses
based on the error code,
and a programmer who is relying too heavily on the general
conventions will fall into a trap.
For a the description of the return values of
@code{marpa_g_rule_rank_set()},
@pxref{Rank methods}.

@node How to read the method descriptions
@section How to read the method descriptions

The method descriptions are written on the assumption
that the reader has the following in mind while reading them:

@itemize
@item Each method description begins with the signature
of its ``topic method''.
@item In the method description, the phrase "this method"
always refers to the topic method.
@item Whenever "this method" is the subject of a sentence
in the method description, it may be elided,
so that, for example,
"This method returns 42" becomes
"Returns 42".
@item If the return type of a method is not @code{void},
the last paragraph of its method description is a
``return value summary''.
The return value summary
starts with the label ``@strong{Return Value}''.
@item Every method returns in exactly one of three
statuses: success, hard failure, or soft failure.
@item A return status of hard failure indicates that the method detected
a hard failure.
@item A method may have several kinds of hard failure,
including several kinds of irrecoverable hard failure
and several kinds of recoverable hard failure.
On return, these can be distinguished by their error codes.
@item If a method call hard fails,
its error code is that associated with the hard failure.
Unless stated otherwise in the return value summary,
the error code is set in the base
grammar of the method call, and may be accessed
with the methods described below.
@xref{Error methods}.
@item If a method allows a recoverable hard failure, this is explicitly stated
in its return value summary,
along with the associated error code.
The method description with state
the circumstances under which the recoverable hard failure occurs,
and what the application must do to recover.
@item A return status of soft failure indicates that the method detected
a soft failure.
@item Every method has at most one kind of soft failure.
@item If a method allows a soft failure, this is explicitly stated
in its return value summary,
and the method description will state
the circumstances under which the soft failure occurs,
and what the application must do to recover.
@item If a method call soft fails, the value of the error code is
unspecified.
@item If a method call succeeds, the value of the error code is
unspecified.
@item A return status of success indicates that the method did not detect
any failures.
@item If both a hard failure and a soft failure occur,
the return status will be hard failure.
@item If both a recoverable hard failure and
an irrecoverable hard failure occur,
the error code will be for an irrecoverable hard failure.
@item The behaviors specified for success and soft failure
are application behaviors.
@item The behaviors specified for hard failures
are diagnostic behaviors if an irrecoverable failure
occurred,
and application behaviors otherwise.

@node Configuration methods
@chapter Configuration methods

The configuration object is intended for future extensions.
These may
allow the application to override Libmarpa's memory allocation
and fatal error handling without resorting to global
variables, and therefore in a thread-safe way.
Currently, the only function of the @code{Marpa_Config}
class is to give
@code{marpa_g_new()}
a place to put its error code.

@code{Marpa_Config} is Libmarpa's only ``major''
class which is not a time class.
There is no constructor or destructor, although
@code{Marpa_Config} objects @strong{do} need to be initialized
before use.
Aside from its own accessor,
@code{Marpa_Config} objects are only used by
@code{marpa_g_new()}
and no reference to their location is not kept
in any of Libmarpa's time objects.
The intent is to that it be convenient
to have them in memory that might be deallocated
soon after
@code{marpa_g_new()}
returns.
For example, they could be put on the stack.

@anchor{marpa_c_init}
@deftypefn {Mutator function} @
int marpa_c_init ( @
  Marpa_Config* @var{config})

Initialize the @var{config} information to ``safe'' default
values.
An irrecoverable error will result
if an uninitialized
configuration is used to create a grammar.

@strong{Return value}: Always succeeds.  The return value is unspecified.

@end deftypefn

@anchor{marpa_c_error}
@deftypefn {Accessor function} @
Marpa_Error_Code marpa_c_error ( @

Error codes are usually kept in the base grammar,
which leaves
@code{marpa_g_new()}
no place to put
its error code on failure.
Objects of
the @code{Marpa_Config} class provide such a place.
@var{p_error_string} is reserved for use by
the internals.
Applications should set it to @code{NULL}.

@strong{Return value}: The error code in @var{config}.
Always succeeds, so that
@code{marpa_c_error()}
never requires an error code
for itself.

@node Grammar methods
@chapter Grammar methods
@cindex grammars

@node Grammar overview
@section Overview

An archetypal application has a grammar.
To create a grammar, use the
@code{marpa_g_new()}
method.
When a grammar is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the
@code{marpa_g_unref()}
method.

To be precomputed,
a grammar must have one or more symbols.
To create symbols, use the
@code{marpa_g_symbol_new()}
method.

To be precomputed,
a grammar must have one or more rules.
To create rules, use the
@code{marpa_g_rule_new()}
and
@code{marpa_g_sequence_new()}
methods.

For non-trivial parsing,
one or more of the symbols must be terminals.
To mark a symbol as a terminal,
use the
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_terminal_set()}
method.

To be precomputed,
a grammar must have exactly one start symbol.
To mark a symbol as the start symbol,
use the
@code{marpa_g_start_symbol_set()}
method.

Before parsing with a grammar, it must be precomputed.
To precompute a grammar,
use the
@code{marpa_g_precompute()}
method.

A rule is a loop rule if it non-trivially
produces the string of length one
that consists only of its LHS symbol.
Such a derivation takes the parse back to where
it started, hence the term ``loop''.
``Non-trivially'' means the zero-step derivation does not count --- the
derivation must have at least one step.

The presence of a loop rule makes a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
and applications will typically want to treat them as fatal errors.
But nothing forces an application to do this,
and Marpa will successfully parse and evaluate grammars with
loop rules.

Soft fails if @var{rule_id} is well-formed (a non-negative integer),

A common hard failure is calling this method with

On success, creates a new external BNF rule in grammar @var{g}.
The ID of the new rule will be a non-negative integer,
which will be unique to that rule.
In addition to BNF rules, Marpa also allows sequence rules,
which are created by
the
@code{marpa_g_sequence_new()} method.
@xref{marpa_g_sequence_new,marpa_g_sequence_new()}.

Sequence rules and BNF rules are both rules:
They share the same series of rule IDs,

with the only differences being as noted
in the descriptions of those methods.

The LHS symbol is @var{lhs_id},

The RHS symbols are in an array
pointed to by @var{rhs_ids}.

Possible hard failures, with their error codes, include:
@itemize
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE}: The LHS symbol is the same
as that of a sequence rule.
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_RULE}: The new rule would duplicate another BNF
rule.
Another BNF rule is considered the duplicate of the new one,
if its LHS symbol is the same as symbol @var{lhs_id},
if its length is the same as @var{length},
and if its RHS symbols match one for one those
in the array of symbols @var{rhs_ids}.

When successful,
adds a new sequence rule to grammar @var{g},
and return its ID.
The ID of the sequence rule will be a non-negative integer,
which is unique to that rule.
All rules are numbered in the same series,
so that a BNF rule will never have the same rule ID as a sequence
rule, and vice versa.

Sequence rules are ``sugar'' ---
their presence in the Libmarpa interface does not extend its power.
Every Libmarpa grammar that can be written using sequence rules
can be rewritten as a grammar without sequence rules.

The LHS of the sequence is @var{lhs_id},
and the item to be repeated on the RHS of the sequence is @var{rhs_id}.
The sequence must be repeated at least @var{min} times,
where @var{min} is 0 or 1.
If @var{separator_id} is non-negative,
it is a separator symbol.

The LHS symbol cannot be the LHS of any other rule,
whether a BNF rule or a sequence rule.
On an attempt to create an sequence rule with a duplicate
LHS,
this method hard fails,
with an error code of
@code{MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE}.

The sequence RHS, or item,
is restricted to a single symbol,
and that symbol cannot be nullable.
If @var{separator_id} is a symbol, it also cannot
be a nullable symbol.
Nullables on the RHS of sequence rules are prohibited
because it is not completely clear what
an application intends
when it asks for a sequence of items,
some of which are nullable ---
the most natural interpretation of this usually results in a highly
ambiguous grammar.

Libmarpa allows highly ambiquous grammars
and a programmer who wants a grammar
with sequences containing nullable items or separators can
can write that grammar using BNF rules.
The use of BNF rules
make it clearer that ambiguity is what the programmer
intended, and allows the programmer more flexibility.

If @code{flags & MARPA_PROPER_SEPARATION} is non-zero,
separation is ``proper'', that is,
a trailing separator is not allowed.
The term
@dfindex proper separation
@dfindex separation, proper
@dfn{proper}
is based on the idea that
properly-speaking, separators should actually separate items.
Proper separation has no effect at the Libmarpa level ---
it is tracked as a convenience for the higher-level interfaces to
Libmarpa,
which may want to offer the ability to
discard separators in the semantics.
(Some higher-level interfaces, in fact, may choose to discard separation by default.)
At the Libmarpa level, sequences always ``keep
separators''.

When a rule is created, it has ``null ranks high'' set.

For more on the
``null ranks high'' setting, read the description of

@item sets ``null ranks high'' in the rule with ID @var{rule_id} if the value
of the boolean @var{flag} is 1;
@item unsets ``null ranks high'' in the rule with ID @var{rule_id} if the value
of the boolean @var{flag} is 0; and
@item returns @var{flag}.
@end itemize

The ``null ranks high'' setting affects the ranking of rules
with properly nullable symbols on their right hand side.
If a rule has properly nullable symbols on its RHS,
each instance in which it appears in a parse will have a pattern
of nulled and non-nulled symbols.
Such a pattern is called a ``null variant''.

If the ``null ranks high'' is set,
nulled symbols rank high.
If the ``null ranks high'' is unset is the default),
nulled symbols rank low.
Ranking of a null variants is done from left-to-right.

Soft fails iff @var{rule_id} is well-formed (a non-negative integer),
but a rule with that ID does not exist.

the grammar has been precomputed.

@deftypefn {Accessor function} @
int marpa_g_has_cycle (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})

On success, returns a boolean which is 1 iff
@var{g} has a cycle.
Cycles make a grammar infinitely ambiguous,
and are considered useless in current
practice.
Cycles make processing the grammar less
efficient, sometimes considerably so.
Applications will almost always want to treat cycles
as mistakes on the part of the writer of the grammar.
To determine which rules are in the cycle,
@code{marpa_g_rule_is_loop()}
can be used.

@strong{Return value}: On success, a boolean.

On hard failure, @minus{}2.

@end deftypefn

@anchor{marpa_g_precompute}
@deftypefn {Mutator function} @
int marpa_g_precompute (Marpa_Grammar @var{g})

On success,
and on fully recoverable hard failure,
precomputes the grammar @var{g}.
Precomputation involves running a series of grammar checks
and ``precomputing'' some useful information which is kept
internally to save repeated calculations.
After precomputation, the grammar is ``frozen'' in many respects,
and many grammar mutators that succeed before precomputation
will cause hard failures after precomputation.
Precomputation is necessary for a recognizer to be generated
from a grammar.

When called, clears any events already in the event queue.
May return one or more events.
The types of event that this method may return
are
A @code{MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES},
@code{MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE},
@code{MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL}.
All of these events occur only on failure.
Applications must be prepared for this method
to return additional events,
including events that occur on success.
Events may be queried using the
@code{marpa_g_event()} method.
@xref{marpa_g_event,marpa_g_event()}.

The fully recoverable hard failure is
@code{MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE}.
Recall that for fully recoverable hard failures
this method precomputes the grammar.
Most appplications, however, will want to treat
a grammar with cycles as if it were
a library-recoverable error.
A @code{MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE} error occurs
iff
a @code{MARPA_EVENT_LOOP_RULES} event occurs.
For more details on cycles,
@pxref{marpa_g_has_cycle,marpa_g_has_cycle()}.

The error code @code{MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE}
is library-recoverable.
This failure occurs when a symbol on the RHS of a sequence rule is
nullable,
which Libmarpa does not allow in a grammar.
Error code @code{MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE} occurs iff
one or more @code{MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE} events occur.
There is one @code{MARPA_EVENT_COUNTED_NULLABLE} event for every symbol
that is a nullable on the right hand side of a sequence
rule.
An application may use these events to inform the user
of the problematic symbols,
and this detail may help the user fix the grammar.

The error code item @code{MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL}
is library-recoverable.
This failure occurs when a nulling
symbol is also flagged as a terminal.
Since terminals cannot be of zero length, this is a logical
impossibility,
and Libmarpa does not allow nulling terminals in a grammar.
Error code item @code{MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL} occurs iff
one or more @code{MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL} events occur.
There is one @code{MARPA_EVENT_NULLING_TERMINAL} events
for every nulling terminal in the grammar.
An application may use these events to inform the user
of the problematic symbols,
and this detail may help the user fix the grammar.

Among the other error codes that may case this
method to fail
are the following:

@itemize
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_NO_RULES}: The grammar has no rules.
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_NO_START_SYMBOL}: No start symbol was specified.
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_INVALID_START_SYMBOL}: A start symbol ID was specified, but it
is not the ID of a valid symbol.
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_START_NOT_LHS}: The start symbol is not on the LHS of any rule.
@item @code{MARPA_ERR_UNPRODUCTIVE_START}: The start symbol is not productive.
@end itemize

More details of these can be found under the
description of the appropriate code.
@xref{External error codes}.

@strong{Return value}: On success, a non-negative number,
whose value is otherwise unspecified.
On hard failure, @minus{}2.
For the error code @code{MARPA_ERR_GRAMMAR_HAS_CYCLE},
the hard failure is fully recoverable.
For the error codes @code{MARPA_ERR_COUNTED_NULLABLE}
and @code{MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL},
the hard failure is library-recoverable.

@node Recognizer methods
@chapter Recognizer methods

@node Recognizer overview
@section Recognizer overview

An archetypal application uses a recognizer to read input.
To create a recognizer, use the
@code{marpa_r_new()}
method.
When a recognizer is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the
@code{marpa_r_unref()}
method.

To make a recognizer ready for input,
use the
@code{marpa_r_start_input()}
method.

The recognizer starts with its current earleme
at location 0.
To read a token at the current earleme,
use the
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
call.

To complete the processing of the current earleme,
and move forward to a new one,
use the
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
call.

@node Creating a new recognizer
@section Creating a new recognizer

@anchor{marpa_r_new}
@deftypefn {Constructor function} @
Marpa_Recognizer marpa_r_new ( Marpa_Grammar @var{g} )

On success, creates a new recognizer and
increments the reference count of @var{g},
the base grammar, by one.
In the new recognizer,
@itemize
@item the reference count will be 1;
@item the furthest earleme will be 0; and
@item the values of the latest and current earleme will be unspecified.
@end itemize

@strong{Return value}:
On success, the newly created recognizer, which is never @code{NULL}.
If @var{g} is not precomputed, or on other hard failure, @code{NULL}.

@section Keeping the reference count of a recognizer

@anchor{marpa_r_ref}

Increases the reference count by 1.
This method is not needed by most applications.

@strong{Return value}:

On hard failure, @code{NULL}.

@end deftypefn

@anchor{marpa_r_unref}
@deftypefn {Destructor function} @
void marpa_r_unref (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r})

Decreases the reference count by 1,
destroying @var{r} once the reference count reaches
zero.
When @var{r} is destroyed, the reference count
of its base grammar is decreased by one.
If this takes the reference count of the base grammar
to zero, the base grammar is also destroyed.

When successful, does the following:
@itemize
@item Readies @var{r} to accept input.
@item
Completes the first Earley set.
The ID of the first Earley set is 0,
and it is located at earleme 0.
@item Leaves the latest, current and furthest earlemes all at 0.
@item Clears any events that were in the event queue before this method was called.
@item If this method exhausts the parse, generates a @code{MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED} event.
    @xref{Exhaustion}.
@item May generate one or more @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_NULLED},
    @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_PREDICTED}, or @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_EXPECTED} events.

int marpa_r_alternative (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r}, @

    int @var{value}, @
    int @var{length})


The @var{token_id} argument must be the symbol ID of a terminal.
The @var{value} argument is an
integer that represents the ``value'' of the
token, and which should not be zero.
The @var{length} argument is the length of the token, which must
be greater than zero.

On success, does the following,
where @var{current} is the value of the current earleme
before the call and
@var{furthest} is the value of the furthest earleme
before the call:
@itemize
@item
Reads a new token into @var{r}.
The symbol ID of the token will be
@var{token_id}.
The token will start at @var{current}
and end at @code{@var{current}+@var{length}}.
@item
Sets the value of the furthest earleme to
@code{max(@var{current}+@var{length},@var{furthest})}.
@item
Leaves
the values of the latest and current earlemes unchanged.
@end itemize

After recoverable failure, the following are the case:
@itemize
@item
The tokens read into @var{r} are unchanged.
Specifically, no new token has been read into @var{r}.
@item
The values of the latest, current and furthest earlemes
are unchanged.
@end itemize

Libmarpa allows tokens to be ambiguous.
Two tokens are ambiguous if they end at the same earleme location.
If two tokens are ambiguous, Libmarpa will attempt to produce all the parses
that include either of them.

Libmarpa allows tokens to overlap.
Let the notation
@var{t}@@@var{s}-@var{e} indicate that token @var{t} starts
at earleme @var{s} and ends at earleme @var{e}.
Let @var{t1}@@@var{s1}-@var{e1}
and @var{t2}@@@var{s2}-@var{e2}
be two tokens such that @var{s1}<=@var{s2}.
We say that @var{t1} and @var{t2} overlap iff
@var{e1}>@var{s2}.

The @var{value} argument
is not used inside Libmarpa --- it is simply
stored to be returned by the valuator
as a convenience for the application.
In applications where the token's actual value is not an integer, it is
expected that the application will use @var{value} as
a ``virtual'' value,
perhaps finding the actual value by using @var{value}
to index an array.
Some applications may prefer to track token values on
their own, perhaps based on
the earleme location and @var{token_id},
instead of using Libmarpa's token values.

A @var{value} of 0 does not cause a failure,
but it is reserved for unvalued symbols,
a now-deprecated feature.
@xref{Valued and unvalued symbols}.

Hard fails irrecoverably with @code{MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_TOKEN}
if the token added would be a duplicate.
Two tokens are duplicates iff all of the following are true:
@itemize
@item They would have the same start earleme.
In other words, if @code{marpa_r_alternative()} attempts
to read them while at the same current earleme.
@item They have the same @var{token_id}.
@item They have the same @var{length}.
@end itemize

@anchor{Ruby Slippers}
If a token was not accepted
because of its token ID,
hard fails with the @code{MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID}.
This hard failure is fully recoverable
so that, for example,
the application may
retry this method with different token IDs
until it succeeds.
These retries are efficient,
and are quite useable as a parsing
technique ---
so much so we have given the technique a name:
@dfindex Ruby Slippers
@dfn{the Ruby Slippers}.
The Ruby Slippers are used in several
applications.

@strong{Return value}:  On success, @code{MARPA_ERR_NONE}.
On failure, an error code other than @code{MARPA_ERR_NONE}.
The hard failure for @code{MARPA_ERR_UNEXPECTED_TOKEN_ID}
is fully recoverable.

@anchor{marpa_r_earleme_complete}
@deftypefn {Mutator function} @
int marpa_r_earleme_complete (Marpa_Recognizer @var{r})


For the purposes of this method description, we define the following:
@itemize
@item @var{current} is the value of the current earleme before the call of
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete}.
@item @var{latest} is the value of the latest earleme before the call of
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete}.
@item An ``expected'' terminal is one expected at a current earleme,
in the same sense that
@code{marpa_r_terminal_is_expected()} determines if a terminal is ``expected''
at the current earleme.
@xref{marpa_r_terminals_expected,marpa_r_terminals_expected()}.
@item An ``anticipated'' terminal is one
that was accepted by
the @code{marpa_r_alternative()} to end at an earleme after the current
earleme.
An anticipated terminal will have length greater than one.
``Anticipated'' terminals only occur if the application is using
an advanced model of input.
@xref{Advanced input models}.
@end itemize

On success, does the final processing for the current earleme, including
the following:
@itemize
@item
Advances the current earleme,
incrementing its value by 1.
That is, sets the current earleme to @code{@var{current}+1}.
@item
If any token was accepted at @var{current},
creates a new Earley set,
which will be the latest Earley set.
After the call, the latest
earleme will be equal to the new current earleme,
@code{@var{current}+1}.
@item
    If no token was accepted at @var{current},
    no Earley set is created.
    After the call,
    the value of the latest earleme will be unchanged ---
    that is, it will remain at @var{latest}.
    Success when no tokens were accepted at @var{current}
    can only occur if the application is using an advanced model of input.
    @xref{Advanced input models}.
@item
The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by
a call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
@item Clears the event queue of any events that
occured before this method was called.
@item May generate one or more @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_COMPLETED},
    @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_NULLED}, @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_PREDICTED},
    or @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_EXPECTED} events.
    @xref{Events}.
@item
If an application-settable threshold
on the number of Earley items has been reached or exceeded,
generates a @code{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD} event.
Often, the application will want to treat this event
as if it were a ancestry-recoverable
failure.
@xref{marpa_r_earley_item_warning_threshold_set,
marpa_r_earley_item_warning_threshold_set()}.
@item If the parse is exhausted,
triggers a
@code{MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED} event.
Exhaustion on success only occurs if no terminals
are expected at the current earleme after
the call to this method
(that is, at @code{@var{current}+1})
and no terminals are anticipated
after @code{@var{current}+1}.
@end itemize

On hard failure
with the code @code{MARPA_ERR_PARSE_EXHAUSTED}, does the following:
@itemize
@item Leaves the current earleme at @var{current}.
The current earleme will be the same as the furthest earleme.
@item
The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by
a call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
@item
Leaves the value of the latest earleme at @var{latest}.
No new Earley set is created.
@item Sets the parse exhausted, so that no more tokens
will be accepted.  @xref{Exhaustion}.
@item Leaves the parse in a state where no terminals
are expected or anticipated.
@item Clears the event queue of any events that
occured before the call to this method.
@item Triggers a
@code{MARPA_EVENT_EXHAUSTED} event and no others.
@item Leaves valid any parses that were valid at
the current or earlier earlemes.
Processing with these can continue,
and it for this reason that we consider
hard failures with the code @code{MARPA_ERR_PARSE_EXHAUSTED}
to be fully recoverable.
@end itemize

We note that exhaustion can occur when this method fails
and when it succeeds.
The distinction is that, on success, the call creates a new Earley set before
becoming exhausted while,
on failure, it becomes exhausted without creating a new Earley set.

This method is commonly called at the top of a loop.
Almost all applications will want to check the return value
and take special action in case of a value other than zero.
If the value is greater than zero, an event will have occurred
and almost all applications
should react to @code{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD} events,
as described above,
and to unexpected events.
If the value is less than zero,
it may be due to an irrecoverable error,
and only in very unusual circumstances will an application wish
to ignore these.

How an application reacts to exhaustion will depend on the kind of
parsing it is doing:
@itemize
@item Very often an application knows the length of its input in advance.
In this case, the application will treat exhaustion before the end of input
as a parse error.
Depending on the application, exhaustion on success at the end of input
might be ignored.
@item An exhaustion-loving application that does not know the length of
its input will often want terminate the parse in case of exhaustion on method
success, treating exhaustion as an end-of-input indicator.
These application will usually want to treat exhaustion on method failure
as a parse error.
@item Occasionally, an exhaustion-hating application may not know
the length of its input in advance.
Since these applications will not know from the length of the input,
or from exhaustion, that they are at end of input,
they will need some other way of determining this.
One way they may do this is with a
@code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_COMPLETED} event.
Typically, these applications will treat exhaustion on method
failure and exhaustion before the end of input
as parse errors.
They may wish to ignore exhaustion on method success
at the end of input.

On success, returns the earleme of the Earley set with ID @code{set_id}.
The ID of an Earley set ID is also called its ordinal.
In the default, token-stream model, Earley set ID and earleme
are always equal, but this is not the case in other input
models.

Hard fails if there is no Earley set whose ID is
@var{set_id}.
This hard failure is fully recoverable.
If @var{set_id} was negative,
the error code of the hard failure is
@code{MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION}.
If @var{set_id} is greater than the ordinal
of the latest Earley set,
the error code of the hard failure is
@code{MARPA_ERR_NO_EARLEY_SET_AT_LOCATION}.

At this writing, there is no method for
the inverse operation (conversion of an earleme to an Earley set
ID).
One consideration in writing
such a method is that not all earlemes correspond to Earley sets.
Applications that want to map earlemes
to Earley sets will have no trouble if they
are using the standard input model ---
the Earley set
ID is always exactly equal to the earleme in that model.
For other applications
that want an earleme-to-ID mapping,
the most general method is create an ID-to-earleme
array using the
@code{marpa_r_earleme()}
method
and invert it.

@strong{Return value}:
On success, the earleme corresponding to Earley

the integer value of the Earley set
can used to store the codepoint of the current character.
In a traditional token-per-earleme input model,
the integer and pointer values could be used to track the string value of the token --
the pointer could point to the start of the string,
and the integer could indicate its length.

The Earley set integer value defaults to @minus{}1,
and the pointer value defaults to @code{NULL}.
The Earley set value and pointer can be set using
the
@code{marpa_r_latest_earley_set_values_set()}
method.

On success, sets
the Earley item warning threshold.
The
@dfindex Earley item warning threshold
@dfn{Earley item warning threshold}
is a number that is compared with
the count of Earley items in each Earley set.
When it is matched or exceeded,
a @code{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD} event is created.
@xref{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD}.

If @var{threshold} is zero or less,
an unlimited number of Earley items
will be allowed without warning.
This will rarely be what the user wants.

By default, Libmarpa calculates a value based on the grammar.
The formula Libmarpa uses is the result of some experience,
and most applications will
be happy with it.

What should be done when the threshold is exceeded, depends on the application,
but exceeding the threshold means that it is very likely
that the time and space resources consumed by
the parse will prove excessive.
This is often a sign of a bug in the grammar.
Applications often will want to smoothly shut down
the parse,
in effect treating
the @code{MARPA_EVENT_EARLEY_ITEM_THRESHOLD} event
as equivalent to library-recoverable hard failure.

@node Progress reports
@chapter Progress reports

It is an important property of the Marpa algorithm that the
Earley sets are added one at a time,
so that
before we have started the construction of the Earley set at @code{n+1},
we know the full state of the parse at and before
location @code{n}.
Libmarpa's progress reports allow access to the Earley items
in an Earley set.

To start a progress report,
use the
@code{marpa_r_progress_report_start()}
command.
For each recognizer,
only one progress report can be in use at any one time.

To step through the Earley items,
use the
@code{marpa_r_progress_item()}
method.

@anchor{marpa_r_progress_report_reset}
@deftypefn {Mutator function} @
int marpa_r_progress_report_reset ( @
  Marpa_Recognizer @var{r})

On success, sets the current vertex of the report traverser
to the null vertex.
For more about the report traverser,
including details about the current and null vertices,
@pxref{marpa_r_progress_report_start,marpa_r_progress_report_start()}.

This method is not usually needed.
Its effect is to leave the traverser in the same state as it is
immediately after the
@code{marpa_r_progress_report_start()} method.
Loosely speaking, it allows the traversal to "start over".

Hard fails if the recognizer is not started,
or if no progress report traverser is active.

@strong{Return value}: On success, a non-negative value.
On failure, @minus{}2.
@end deftypefn

@anchor{marpa_r_progress_report_start}
@deftypefn {Mutator function} @
int marpa_r_progress_report_start ( @
  Marpa_Recognizer @var{r}, @
  Marpa_Earley_Set_ID @var{set_id})

Creates a progress report traverser
in recognizer @var{r}
for the Earley set with ID @var{set_id}.
A
@dfindex progress report traverser
@dfindex traverser, progress report
@dfn{progress report traverser}
is a non-empty directed cycle graph whose vertices consist
of the following:
@itemize
@item For every Earley item,
exactly one vertex that corresponds to
that Earley item.
This vertex is called the
@dfindex progress report item
@dfn{progress report item}
or, when the meaning is clear, the
@dfindex report item
@dfn{report item}.
In this method description,
we will say the the number of report items is @code{n},
and we will write @code{ritem[i]}
for the @code{i}'th report item.
@item A special vertex, called the
@dfindex null vertex
@dfindex vertex, null
@dfn{null vertex},
which does not correspond
to any Earley item.
In this method description, we will write @code{null} for
the null vertex.
@end itemize

There may be no Earley items in an Earley set,
and therefore a progress report traverser may contain no report items.
A progress report traverser with no report items is called a
``trivial traverser''.
A trivial traverser has exactly one edge: @code{(null, null)}.

The edges of a non-trivial traverser are
@itemize
@item @code{(null, ritem[0])},
@item @code{(ritem[n-1], null)}, and
@item for every @code{0 <= i < v-1}, @code{(ritem[i-1], ritem[i])}.
@end itemize
This implies that every vertex has exactly one direct successor.
The report items are a subgraph,
and this graph can be seen as inducing the sequence @code{ritem[0] ... ritem[n-1]}.

When a progress report traverser is active, one vertex is distinguished as the
@dfindex current vertex (of a progress report traverser)
@dfindex vertex, current (of a progress report traverser)
@dfn{current vertex},
which we will write as @code{current}.
We call the direct successor of the current vertex,
the
@dfindex next vertex (of a progress report traverser)
@dfindex vertex, next (of a progress report traverser)
@dfn{next vertex}.

On success, does the following:
@itemize
@item If a progress report traverser was active in this recognizer before this method call,
it is destroyed and its memory is freed..
@item Creates a new progress report traverser from the Earley items for the
Earley set with ID @var{set_id}.
@item Activates the newly created progress report traverser,
setting the current vertex to the null vertex.
Intuitively, in a non-trivial traverser,
this can be thought of as positioning the
traverser before the first report item.
@item Returns @code{n}, the number of report items.
    @code{n} may be zero.
@end itemize

Hard fails if no Earley set with ID
@var{set_id} exists.
The error code is @code{MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION} if @var{set_id}
is negative.
The error code is @code{MARPA_ERR_NO_EARLEY_SET_AT_LOCATION}
if @var{set_id} is greater than the ID of
the latest Earley set.

for recognizer @var{r},

For details about the report traverser,
@pxref{marpa_r_progress_report_start,marpa_r_progress_report_start()}.

It is often not necessary to call this method.
@code{marpa_r_progress_report_start()} destroys
any previously existing progress report.
And,
when a recognizer is destroyed,
its progress report is destroyed as a side effect.

Hard fails if no progress report is active.

This method allows access to the data
for the next progress report item of a
progress report.
For details about progress reports,
@pxref{marpa_r_progress_report_start,marpa_r_progress_report_start()}.

In the event of success:
@itemize
@item Advances the current vertex to the next vertex.
More precisely, let @code{c_before} be the vertex
that is the current vertex immediately
before the call to this method.
The report item traverser has exactly one edge such that @code{c_before}
is its first element.
Let this edge be @code{(c_before,c_after)}.
This method sets the current vertex to @code{c_after}.
In this method description, we will write @code{current} as an alias for @code{c_after}.
@item @code{current} will be a report item vertex and therefore there will
be an Earley item corresponding to @code{current}.
@item Writes the "cooked dot position" of the Earley item corresponding to @code{current}
to the location pointed to by the @var{position} argument.
@item Writes the origin of the Earley item corresponding to @code{current}
to the location pointed to by the @var{origin} argument.
@item Returns the rule ID of the Earley item corresponding to @code{current}.
@end itemize

The "cooked dot position" is
@itemize
@item the standard 0-based start-relative
dot position, if the dotted rule is @strong{not} a completion; and
@item the end-relative dot position, where the last position is
@minus{}1, if the dotted rule @strong{is} a completion.
@end itemize
Use of the cooked dot position allows an application to quickly
determine if the dotted rule is a completion.
The cooked dot position is @minus{}1 iff the dotted rule is a completion.

In the event of soft failure:
@itemize
@item @code{current} is the null vertex.
@item Sets the error code to @code{MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_EXHAUSTED}.
@item Leaves unchanged the locations pointed to by
the @var{position} and @var{origin} arguments.
@item Returns @minus{}1.
@end itemize

In addition to watching for soft failure,
the application can use the item count returned by
@code{marpa_r_progress_report_start()}
to determine when the last
item has been seen.

@strong{Return value}: On success, the rule ID of
the progress report item, which is always non-negative.
On soft failure, @minus{}1.
If either the @var{position} or the @var{origin}
argument is @code{NULL},
or on other hard failure, @minus{}2.

@node Bocage data structure
@section Bocage data structure

A bocage is a data structure containing the parses
found by processing the input according to the grammar.
It is related to a parse forest,
but is in a form that is more compact and easily traversable.
``Bocage'' is our term, and we discovered this structure
independently,
but our work was preceded by Elizabeth Scott.
And, unlike us,
Prof. Scott did the all-important
work of documenting it and providing the
appropriate mathematical apparatus.
@xref{Elizabeth Scott's SPPFs}.

The bocage contains the data for the parse trees whose root is
an instance of the start symbol that begins at Earley set 0
and ends at the
@dfindex End of parse Earley set
@dfindex Earley set, end of parse
@dfn{end of parse Earley set}.
Applications usually use the Earley set at the current earleme
as the
``end of parse Earley set'',
so that the bocage is for parses of the entire input.
But some applications may be interested in parsing prefixes of
the input, and these applications can choose other
end of parse Earley sets in their constructor.
@xref{marpa_b_new,marpa_b_new()}.

@xref{Better defined ambiguity metric}.

If ``high rank only'' is in effect,
this ambiguity metric may differ from that returned by

In particular, a ``high rank only'' ordering
may be unambiguous even if its base bocage is ambiguous.
But note also,
because multiple parses choices may have the same rank,
a ``high rank only'' ordering may be ambiguous.

If the ordering is not already frozen,
it will be frozen on return from

For our purposes,

@node Value methods
@chapter Value methods

@node Value overview
@section Overview

The archetypal application needs
a value object (or
@dfindex valuator
@dfn{valuator}) to produce
the value of the parse.
To create a valuator, use the
@code{marpa_v_new()}
method.

The application is required to maintain the stack,
and the application is also required to implement
most of the semantics, including the evaluation
of rules.
Libmarpa's valuator provides instructions to
the application on how to manipulate the stack.
To iterate through this series of instructions,
use the
@code{marpa_v_step()}
method.

When successful, @code{marpa_v_step()}
returns the type
of step.
Most step types have values associated with them.
@xref{Basic step accessors},
@pxref{How to use the valuator}, and
@pxref{Stepping through the valuator}.

When a valuator is no longer in use, its memory can be freed
using the
@code{marpa_v_unref()}
method.

@node How to use the valuator
@section How to use the valuator
Libmarpa's valuator provides the application with
``steps'', which are
instructions for stack manipulation.
Libmarpa itself does not maintain a stack.
This leaves the upper layer in total control of the
stack and the values that are placed on it.

As example may make this clearer.
Suppose the evalution is at a place in the parse tree
where an addition is being performed.
Libmarpa does not know that the operation
is an addition.
It will tell the application that rule number @var{R}
is to be applied to the arguments at stack locations
@var{N} and @var{N}+1, and that the result is to placed in
stack location @var{N}.

In this system
the application keeps track of the semantics for all
rules, so it looks up rule @var{R} and determines that it
is an addition.
The application can do this by using @var{R} as an index
into an array of callbacks, or by any other method
it chooses.
Let's assume a callback implements the semantics
for rule @var{R}.
Libmarpa has told the application that two arguments
are available for this operation, and that they are
at locations @var{N} and @var{N}+1 in the stack.
They might be the numbers 42 and 711.
So the callback is called with its two arguments,
and produces a return value, let's say, 753.
Libmarpa has told the application that the result
belongs at location @var{N} in the stack,
so the application writes 753 to location @var{N}.

Since Libmarpa knows nothing about the semantics,
the operation for rule R could be string concatenation
instead of addition.
Or, if it is addition, it could allow for its arguments
to be floating point or complex numbers.
Since the application maintains the stack, it is up
to the application whether the stack contains integers,
strings, complex numbers, or polymorphic objects that are
capable of being any of these things and more.

@node Advantages of step-driven valuation
@section Advantages of step-driven valuation

Step-driven valuation
hides Libmarpa's grammar rewrites from the application,
and is quite efficient.
Libmarpa knows which rules are sequences.
Libmarpa optimizes stack manipulations based on this knowledge.
Long sequences
are very common in practical grammars.
For these,
the stack manipulations suggested by Libmarpa's
step-driven valuator
will be significantly faster than the
traditional stack evaluation algorithm.

Step-driven evalution has another advantage.
To illustrate this,
consider what is a very common case:
The semantics are implemented in a higher-level language,
using callbacks.
If Libmarpa did not use step-driven valuation,
it would need to provide for this case.
But for generality,
Libmarpa would have to deal in C callbacks.
Therefore, a middle layer would have to create C language wrappers
for the callbacks in the higher level language.

The implementation that results is this:
The higher level language would need to wrap each callback in C.
When calling Libmarpa, it would pass the wrappered callback.
Libmarpa would then need to call the C language ``wrappered'' callback.
Next, the wrapper would call the higher-level language callback.
The return value,
which would be data native to the higher-level language,
would need to be passed to the C language wrapper,
which will need to make arrangements for it to be based
back to the higher-level language when appropriate.

A setup like this is not terribly efficient.
And exception handling across language boundaries would be
very tricky.

But neither of these is the worst problem.
The worst problem is that callbacks are hard to debug.
Wrappered callbacks are even worse.
Calls made across language boundaries
are harder yet to debug.
In the system described above,
by the time a return value is finally consumed,
a language boundary will have been crossed four times.
The ability to debug can make the difference between
code that works and code that does not work.

So, while step-driven valuation seems
a roundabout approach,
it is simpler and more direct than
the likely alternatives.
And there is something to be said for pushing
semantics up to the higher levels ---
they can be expected to know more about it.

These advantages of step-driven valuation
are strictly in
the context of a low-level interface.
We are under no illusion
that direct use of Libmarpa's valuator will be found
satisfactory by most Libmarpa users,
even those using the C language.
Libmarpa's valuator is intended
to be used via an upper layer,
one that @strong{does} know about semantics.

@node Maintaining the stack
@section Maintaining the stack

This section discusses in detail the requirements
for maintaining the stack.
In some cases,
such as implementation using a Perl array,
fulfilling these requirements is trivial.
Perl auto-extends its arrays,
and initializes the element values,
on every read or write.
For the C programmer,
things are not quite so easy.

In this section,
we will assume a C89 standard-conformant
C application.
This assumption is convenient on two grounds.
First, this will be the intended use
for many readers.
Second, standard-conformant C89 is
a ``worst case''.
Any issue faced by a programmer of another environment
is likely to also be one that must be solved
by the C programmer.

Libmarpa often
optimizes away unnecessary stack writes
to stack locations.
When it does so, it will not
necessarily optimize away all reads
to that stack location.
This means that a location's first access,
as suggested by the Libmarpa step instructions,
may be a read.
This possibility
requires a special awareness from the C
programmer.
@xref{Sizing the stack}.

@node Sizing the stack
@subsection Sizing the stack

In our discussion of the stack handler for the valuator,
we will treat the stack as a 0-based array.
If an implementation applies Libmarpa's step
instructions literally, using a physical stack,
it must make sure that all locations in the stack are initialized.
The range of locations that must be initialized is from
stack location 0 to the ``end of stack'' location.
The result of the parse is always stored in stack location 0,
so that a stack location 0 is always needed.
Therefore, the end of stack location is always a specified value, and greater than or equal to 0.
The end of stack location must also be greater than or equal to
@itemize
@item
@code{marpa_v_result(v)} for every @code{MARPA_STEP_TOKEN} step,
@item
@code{marpa_v_result(v)}
for every @code{MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL} step, and
@item
@code{marpa_v_arg_n(v)}
for every @code{MARPA_STEP_RULE} step.
@end itemize

In practice, an application will often extend the stack
as it iterates through the steps,
initializing the new stack locations as they are created.

Note that our requirement is not merely that the stack locations
exist and be writable, but that they be initialized.
This is necessary for C89 conformance.
Because of write optimizations in our implementation,
the first access to any stack location
may be a read.
C89 allows trap values,
so that a read of an uninitialized location could result
in undefined behavior.
@xref{Trap representations}.

@node Step location accessors
@section Step location accessors

This section describes step accessors that are not basic to stack manipulation.
They provide Earley set location information about the parse.

A step's location in terms of Earley sets is called its ES location.
Every ES location is the ID of an Earley set.

ES location is only relevant for parse nodes.
A parse node is either a leaf node or a rule node.
The step type for a rule node is MARPA_STEP_RULE.
A leaf node is either a nulled node,
or a token node.
The step type for a nulled node is MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL.
The step type for a token node is MARPA_STEP_TOKEN.

Every parse node has both a start ES location
and an end ES location.
The start ES location is the first ES location of
that parse node.

The end ES location of a leaf is the ES location where
the next leaf symbol in the fringe of the current parse would start.
Typically, this is the location where a leaf node actually starts but,
toward the end of a parse, there may not be an actual next leaf node.

The start ES location of a MARPA_RULE_STEP is the start ES location
of its first child node in the current parse tree.
The end ES location of a MARPA_RULE_STEP is the end ES location
of its last child node in the current parse tree.

@deftypefn {Accessor macro} @
Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_v_es_id (Marpa_Value v)

@strong{Return value}:
If the current step type is MARPA_STEP_RULE, MARPA_STEP_TOKEN, or MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL,
the return value is the end ES location of the parse node.
If the current step type is anything else,
or if the valuator is inactive,
the return value is unspecified.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Accessor macro} @
Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_v_rule_start_es_id (Marpa_Value v)

@strong{Return value}:
If the current step type is MARPA_STEP_RULE, the start ES location of the rule node.
If the current step type is anything else,
or if the valuator is inactive,
the return value is unspecified.
@end deftypefn

@deftypefn {Accessor macro} @
Marpa_Earley_Set_ID marpa_v_token_start_es_id (Marpa_Value v)

@strong{Return value}:
If the current step type is MARPA_STEP_TOKEN or MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL,
the start ES location of the leaf node.
If the current step type is anything else,
or if the valuator is inactive,
the return value is unspecified.
@end deftypefn

For every parse node of the current parse tree,
the Earley set length (ES length) of the node is the end ES location,
less the start ES location.
The ES length of a nulled node is always 0.

If v is a valuator whose current step type is MARPA_STEP_NULLING_SYMBOL, it is always the case that

@verbatim
         marpa_v_token_start_es_id(v) == marpa_v_es_id(v)
@end verbatim

If v is a valuator whose current step type is MARPA_STEP_RULE or MARPA_STEP_TOKEN,
it is always the case that

@verbatim
        marpa_v_token_start_es_id(v) <= marpa_v_es_id(v)
@end verbatim

For the following examples,
@itemize
@item let @verb{|Null|} be a nulling symbol,
@item let @verb{|Tok|} be a non-nullable symbol, and
@item let the notation @verb{|Sym@m-n|} indicate that the symbol
@verb{|Sym|} has ES start location @verb{|m|} and ES end location @verb{|n|}.
@end itemize

Ordered from left to right, a possible fringe is
@verbatim
        Null@0-0, Tok@0-1, Null@1-1, Tok@1-2, Null@2-2
@end verbatim
Another example is
@verbatim
        Null@0-0, Null@0-0, Tok@0-1, Null@1-1, Null@1-1, Tok@1-2,
        Null@2-2, Null@2-2
@end verbatim
In this second example note that when a nulled leaf immediately follows another
nulled leaf, both leaves has the same start ES location and the same end ES location.
This makes sense, because nulled symbol instances do not advance the current ES location,
but it also implies that the ES locations and LHS symbol
cannot be used to uniquely identify a parse node.

@node Events
@chapter Events

@node Events overview
@section Overview

This chapter discusses Libmarpa's events.
It contains descriptions of both grammar and recognizer methods.

A method is
@dfindex event-generating (method)
@dfn{event-generating}
iff it can add events to the event queue.
The event-generating methods are
@code{marpa_g_precompute()},
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()},
and
@code{marpa_r_start_input()}.
The event-generating methods always clear all previous events
so that, on return from an event-generating method,
the only events in the event queue will be
the events generated by that method.

A Libmarpa method or macro is
@dfindex event-safe (method)
@dfn{event-safe}
iff it does not change the events queue.
All Libmarpa accessors are event-safe.

Regardless of the event-safety of the methods calls
between event generation and event access,
it is good practice to access events
as soon as reasonable after the method that generated them.
Note that events are kept in the base grammar,
so that multiple recognizers using the same base grammar
overwrite each other's events.

To find out how many events are in the event queue,
use the
@code{marpa_g_event_count()}
method.

To access specific events,
use the
@code{marpa_g_event()}
and
@code{marpa_g_event_value()}
methods.

@node Completion events
@section Completion events

Libmarpa can be set up to generate
a @code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_COMPLETED} event
whenever the symbol is completed.
A symbol is said to be @strong{completed}
when a non-nulling rule with
that symbol on its LHS is completed.

For a completion event to be generated,
the symbol must be
@dfindex mark (as a completion event symbol)
@dfn{marked},
and the event must be
@dfindex activate (a completion symbol event)
@dfn{activated}.

To mark a symbol as a completion event symbol
use the @code{marpa_g_symbol_is_completion_event_set()}
method.
The event will be activated by default.

To activate or deactivate a completion symbol event
use the @code{marpa_r_completion_symbol_activate()}

A symbol instance can never generated both a nulled
and a prediction event at the same location.
Also, a symbol instance can never generate both a nulled
and a completion event at the same location.
(As a reminder, a symbol instance is a symbol
starting at a specific location in the input,
and with a specific length.)
This is because the symbol instance for a nulled
event must be zero length,
and the symbol instance for prediction and completion
events can never be zero length.

However, prediction and nulled events for the
same symbol can trigger at the same location.
This is because
The same location can be the location of a nulled instance
of a symbol,
and the start of an non-nulled instance of the same symbol.

Also, completion and nulled events for the
same symbol can trigger at the same location.
This is because
the same location can be the location of a nulled instance
of a symbol,
and the end of one or more non-nulled instances of the same symbol.

The
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_nulled_event_set()}
method will
mark a symbol as a nulled event symbol,
even if the symbol is non-nullable.
This is convenient, for example,
for automatically generated grammars.
Applications that wish to treat
it as a failure if there is an
attempt to
mark a non-nullable symbol
as a nulled event symbol,
can check for this case using
the
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_nullable()}
method.

If @var{sym_id} is well-formed, but there is no
such symbol, soft fails.

Allows the user to deactivate and reactivate symbol prediction
events in the grammar.
When a recognizer is created,
the activation status of each of its events is initialized
to the activation status of that event in the base grammar.
If @var{reactivate} is zero, the event is deactivated
in the grammar.
If @var{reactivate} is one, the event is activated
in the grammar.

Symbol prediction events are active by default if
the symbol was set up for prediction events in the
grammar.
If a symbol was not set up for prediction events in
the grammar, symbol prediction events are inactive
by default and any attempt to change that is a fatal error.

The activation status of a prediction event in the grammar
can only be changed if the symbol is marked as a prediction event symbol
in the grammar,
and before
the grammar is precomputed.
However, if a symbol is marked as a prediction event symbol in
the recognizer,
the prediction event can be deactivated
and reactivated in the recognizer.

Success cases:
On success,
the method returns the value of @var{reactivate}.
The method succeeds trivially
if the symbol is already set as indicated by
@var{reactivate}.

Failure cases:

Libmarpa can be set up
to generate a
@code{MARPA_EVENT_SYMBOL_PREDICTED}
event when a non-nulled symbol is predicted.
A non-nulled symbol is said to be @strong{predicted}
when a instance of it
is acceptable at the current
earleme according to the grammar.
Nulled symbols do not generate predictions.

For predicted events to occur, the symbol must be marked
as a predicted event symbol.
The
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_predicted_event_set()}
function
marks symbol @var{sym_id} as a predicted event symbol
if @var{value} is 1,
and unmarks it
it as a predicted event symbol if @var{value} is 0.
The
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_predicted_event()}
method
returns the current value of the predicted event marking
for symbol @var{sym_id}.

Marking a prediction event sets its activation status to on.
Unmarking a prediction event sets its activation status to off.
The prediction event marking cannot be changed once
the grammar is precomputed.

If a prediction event is marked,
its activation status can be changed using the
@code{marpa_g_prediction_symbol_activate()}
method.
Note that, if a symbol is marked as a prediction event symbol
in the recognizer,
its prediction event can be deactivated
and reactivated in the recognizer.

Success: On success, 1 if symbol @var{sym_id}
is a predicted event symbol after the
call, 0 otherwise.

Failures:

A recognizer event is created whenever

The ``expected symbol event bit'' must be 1 or 0.

In this context, ``expected'' means ``expected as a terminal''.
Even if a symbol is predicted at the current earleme,
if it is not acceptable as a terminal,
it does not trigger an
``expected symbol event''.

By default, the ``expected symbol event bit'' is 0.
It is an error to attempt to set the

The grammar has a cycle --- one or more loop
rules.
This is a recoverable error,
although most applications will want to treat
it as fatal.
For more see the description of @ref{marpa_g_precompute}.
Numeric value: 17.
Suggested message: "Grammar has cycle".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_HEADERS_DO_NOT_MATCH
This is an internal error, and indicates that
Libmarpa was wrongly built.
Libmarpa was compiled with headers that do not
match the rest of the code.
The solution is to find a correctly built
Libmarpa.
Numeric value: 98.
Suggested message: "Internal error: Libmarpa was built incorrectly"
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_I_AM_NOT_OK
The Libmarpa base grammar is in a "not ok"
state.
Currently, the only way this can happen
is if Libmarpa memory is being overwritten.
Numeric value: 29.
Suggested message: "Marpa is in a not OK state".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INACCESSIBLE_TOKEN
This error code indicates that
the token symbol is an inaccessible symbol --- one that
cannot be reached from the start symbol.

Since the inaccessibility of a symbol is a property of the grammar,
this error code typically indicates an application error.
Nevertheless, a retry at this location, using another token ID,
may succeed.
At this writing,
the author knows of no uses of this technique.

Numeric value: 18.
Suggested message: "Token symbol is inaccessible".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_BOOLEAN
A function was called that takes a boolean argument,
but the value of that argument was not either 0 or 1.
Numeric value: 22.
Suggested message: "Argument is not boolean".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_LOCATION
The location (Earley set ID) is not valid.
It may be invalid for one of two reasons:
@itemize
@item It is negative,
and it is being used as the argument to a method
for which that negative value does not have a special meaning.
@item It is after the latest Earley set.
@end itemize

For users of input models other than the standard one,
the term ``location'', as used in association
with this error code,
means Earley set ID or Earley set ordinal.
In the standard input model, this will always
be identical with Libmarpa's other idea of
location, the earleme.

Numeric value: 25.
Suggested message: "Location is not valid".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_START_SYMBOL
A start symbol was specified,
but its symbol ID is not that of a valid symbol.
Numeric value: 27.
Suggested message: "Specified start symbol is not valid".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_ASSERTION_ID
A method was called with an invalid assertion ID.
This is a assertion ID that not only does
not exist, but cannot exist.
Currently that means its value is less than zero.
Numeric value: 96.
Suggested message: "Assertion ID is malformed".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_RULE_ID
A method was called with an invalid rule ID.
This is a rule ID that not only does
not exist, but cannot exist.
Currently that means its value is less than zero.
Numeric value: 26.
Suggested message: "Rule ID is malformed".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_INVALID_SYMBOL_ID
A method was called with an invalid symbol ID.
This is a symbol ID that not only does

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_MINOR_VERSION_MISMATCH
There was a mismatch in the minor version number
between the requested version

Numeric value: 32.
Suggested message: "Libmarpa minor version number is a mismatch".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NO_EARLEY_SET_AT_LOCATION
A non-negative Earley set ID (also called an Earley set ordinal)
was specified,
but there is no corresponding Earley set.
Since the Earley set ordinals are in sequence,
this means that the specified ID is greater
than that of the latest Earley set.
Numeric value: 39.
Suggested message: "Earley set ID is after latest Earley set".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NOT_PRECOMPUTED
The grammar is not precomputed,
and attempt was made to do something with it
that is not allowed for unprecomputed
grammars.
For example, a recognizer cannot be
created from a grammar until it is precomputed.
Numeric value: 34.
Suggested message: "This grammar is not precomputed".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NO_PARSE
The application attempted to create a bocage
from a recognizer without a parse.
Applications will often want to treat this as
a soft error.
Numeric value: 41.
Suggested message: "No parse".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NO_RULES
A grammar that has no rules is being used
in a way that is not allowed.
Usually the problem is that the user is
trying to precompute the grammar.
Numeric value: 42.
Suggested message: "This grammar does not have any rules".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NO_START_SYMBOL
The grammar has no start symbol,
and an attempt was made to perform an
operation that requires one.
Usually the problem is that the user is
trying to precompute the grammar.
Numeric value: 43.
Suggested message: "This grammar has no start symbol".

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NO_SUCH_SYMBOL_ID
A method was called with a symbol ID that is well-formed,
but the symbol does not exist.
Numeric value: 90.
Suggested message: "No symbol with this ID exists".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NO_TOKEN_EXPECTED_HERE
This error code indicates that
no tokens at all were expected at this earleme
location.
This can only happen in alternative input models.

Typically, this indicates an application programming
error.
Retrying input at this location will always fail.
But if the application is able to leave this
earleme empty, a retry at a later location,
using this or another token,
may succeed.
At this writing,
the author knows of no uses of this technique.

Numeric value: 44.
Suggested message: "No token is expected at this earleme location".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NOT_A_SEQUENCE
This error occurs in situations where a rule
is required to be a sequence,
and indicates that the rule of interest is,
in fact,
not a sequence.

Numeric value: 99.
Suggested message: "Rule is not a sequence".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_NULLING_TERMINAL
Marpa does not allow a symbol to be both nulling
and a terminal.
Numeric value: 49.
Suggested message: "A symbol is both terminal and nulling".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_ORDER_FROZEN
The Marpa order object has been frozen.
If a Marpa order object is frozen, it cannot be
changed.

Multiple tree iterators can share a Marpa order object,
but that order object is frozen after the first tree
iterator is created from it.
Applications can order an bocage in many ways,
but they must do so by creating multiple order objects.

Numeric value: 50.
Suggested message: "The ordering is frozen".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_PARSE_EXHAUSTED
The parse is exhausted.
Numeric value: 53.
Suggested message: "The parse is exhausted".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_PARSE_TOO_LONG
The parse is too long.
The limit on the length of a parse is implementation
dependent, but it is very large,
at least 500,000,000 earlemes.

This error code is unlikely in the standard input model.
Almost certainly memory would be exceeded
before it could occur.
If an application sees this error,
it almost certainly using one of the non-standard
input models.

Most often this message will occur because
of a request to add a single extremely long token,
perhaps as a result of an application error.
But it is also possible this error condition will
occur after the input of a large number
of long tokens.

Numeric value: 54.
Suggested message: "This input would make the parse too long".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_POINTER_ARG_NULL
In a method that takes pointers as arguments,
one of the pointer arguments is @code{NULL},
in a case where that is not allowed.
One such method is@
@code{marpa_r_progress_item()}.
Numeric value: 56.
Suggested message: "An argument is null when it should not be".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_PRECOMPUTED
An attempt was made to use a precomputed grammar
in a way that is not allowed.
Often this is an attempt to change the grammar.
Nearly every change to a grammar after
precomputation invalidates the precomputation,
and is therefore not allowed.
Numeric value: 57.
Suggested message: "This grammar is precomputed".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_NOT_STARTED
No recognizer progress report is currently active,
and an action has been attempted that
requires the progress report to be active.
One such action would be a
@code{marpa_r_progress_item()}
call.
Numeric value: 59.
Suggested message: "No progress report has been started".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_EXHAUSTED
The progress report is ``exhausted'' --- all its
items have been iterated through.
Numeric value: 58.
Suggested message: "The progress report is exhausted".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_RANK_TOO_LOW
A symbol or rule rank was specified that
was less than an implementation-defined minimum.
Implementations will always allow at least those
ranks in the range between
@minus{}134,217,727 and 134,217,727.
Numeric value: 85.
Suggested message: "Rule or symbol rank too low".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_RANK_TOO_HIGH
A symbol or rule rank was specified that
was greater than an implementation-defined maximum.
Implementations will always allow at least those
ranks in the range between
@minus{}134,217,727 and 134,217,727.
Numeric value: 86.
Suggested message: "Rule or symbol rank too high".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_RECCE_IS_INCONSISTENT
The recognizer is ``inconsistent'',
usually because the user has rejected one or
more rules or terminals,
and has not yet called
the
@code{marpa_r_consistent()}

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_RHS_IX_NEGATIVE
The index of a RHS symbol was specified,
and it was negative.
That is not allowed.
Numeric value: 63.
Suggested message: "RHS index cannot be negative".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_RHS_IX_OOB
A non-negative index of RHS symbol was specified,
but there is no symbol at that index.
Since the indexes are in sequence, this means the
index was greater than or equal to the rule length.
Numeric value: 64.
Suggested message: "RHS index must be less than rule length".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_RHS_TOO_LONG
An attempt was made to add a rule with too many
right hand side symbols.
The limit on the RHS symbol count is implementation
dependent, but it is very large,
at least 500,000,000 symbols.
This is
far beyond what is required in any current practical grammar.
An application with rules of this length is almost
certain to run into memory and other limits.
Numeric value: 65.
Suggested message: "The RHS is too long".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_SEQUENCE_LHS_NOT_UNIQUE
The LHS of a
sequence rule cannot be the LHS of any other rule,
whether a sequence rule or a BNF rule.
An attempt was made to violate this restriction.
Numeric value: 66.
Suggested message: "LHS of sequence rule would not be unique".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_START_NOT_LHS
The start symbol is not on the LHS on
any rule.
That means it could never match any possible input,
not even the null string.
Presumably, an error in writing the grammar.
Numeric value: 73.
Suggested message: "Start symbol not on LHS of any rule".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_SYMBOL_IS_NOT_COMPLETION_EVENT
An attempt was made to use a symbol in
a way that requires it to be

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_SYMBOL_VALUED_CONFLICT
Unvalued symbols are a deprecated Marpa feature,
which may be avoided with
the
@code{marpa_g_force_valued()}
method.
An unvalued symbol may take on any value,
and therefore a symbol that is unvalued at some points
cannot safely to be used to contain a value at
others.
This error indicates that such an unsafe use is
being attempted.
Numeric value: 74.
Suggested message: "Symbol is treated both as valued and unvalued".

Zero-length tokens are not allowed in Libmarpa.
Numeric value: 77.
Suggested message: "Token length must greater than zero".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_TOKEN_TOO_LONG
The token length is too long.
The limit on the length of a token
is implementation dependent, but it
is at least 500,000,000 earlemes.
An application using a token that long
is almost certain to run into some other

it has no more parses.
Numeric value: 79.
Suggested message: "Tree iterator is exhausted".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_TREE_PAUSED
A Libmarpa tree is ``paused''
and an operation was attempted that

Numeric value: 84.
Suggested message: "The valued status of the symbol is locked".
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {Accessor macro} int MARPA_ERR_SYMBOL_IS_NULLING
An attempt was made to do something with a nulling
symbol that is not allowed.
For example,
the ID of a nulling symbol cannot be an argument
to

@node Internal error codes
@section Internal error codes

An internal error code may be one of two things:
First,
it can be an error code that
arises from an internal Libmarpa programming issue
(in other words, something happening in the code
that was not supposed to be able to happen.)
Second, it can be an error code that only occurs
when a method from Libmarpa's internal interface
is used.
Both kinds of internal error message share one common
trait --- users of the Libmarpa's external interface
should never see them.

Internal error messages
require someone with knowledge of the Libmarpa internals
to follow up on them.
They usually do not have descriptions or suggested messages.

to classify every error condition.
Unless they are using a developer's version,
users of the external interface
should never

One of our most important data structures is what we call a "bocage".
Prof. Scott's work preceded ours,
and her SPPF structure is our bocage in all essential respects,
so much so that her excellent writeup serves perfectly
as documentation for the bocage:

@node Data types used by Libmarpa
@section Data types used by Libmarpa

Libmarpa does not use any floating point data or strings.
All data are either integers or pointers.

@node Why so many time objects
@section Why so many time objects?

Marpa is an aggressively multi-pass algorithm.
Marpa achieves its efficiency,
not in spite of making multiple
passes over the data, but because of it.
Marpa regularly substitutes
two fast O(@var{n}) passes for a single
O(@var{n} log @var{n}) pass.
Marpa's proliferation of time objects is in
keeping with its multi-pass approach.

Bocage objects come at no cost,
even for unambiguous parses,
because the same pass that creates the bocage
also deals with other issues that are of major
significance for unambiguous parses.
It is the post-processing of the bocage pass
that enables Marpa to do both left-
and right-recursion in linear time.

Of the various objects, the best
case for elimination is of the
ordering object.
In many cases, the ordering is trivial.
Either the parse is unambiguous, or the
application does not care about the order in
which parses are returned.
But while it would be easy to add an option
to bypass creation of an ordering object,
there is little to be gained from it.
When the ordering is trivial,
its overhead is very small ---
essentially a handful of subroutine calls.
Many orderings accomplish nothing,
but these cost next to nothing.

Tree objects come at minimal cost to unambiguous grammars,
because the same pass that allows iteration through multiple
parse trees does the tree traversal.
This eliminates much of the work that otherwise would
need to be done in
the valuation time object.
In the current implementation, the valuation time object
needs only to step through a sequence already determined
by the tree iterator.

@node Design of numbered objects
@section Numbered objects

As the name suggests,
the choice was made to implement
numbered objects as integers,
and not as
pointers.
In standard-conformant C,
integers can be safely checked for validity,
while pointers cannot.

There are efficiency tradeoffs between pointers and
integers but they are complicated,
and they go both ways.
Pointers can be faster, but integers can be used
as indexes into more than one data structure.
Which is actually faster depends on the design.
Integers allow for a more flexible design,
so that once the choice is settled on,
careful programming can make them a win,
possibly a very big one.

The approach taken in Libmarpa was to settle,
from the outset,
on integers as the implementation for numbered
objects,
and to optimize on that basis.
The author concedes that it is
possible that
others redoing Libmarpa from scratch
might find that pointers are faster.
But the author is confident
that they will also discover,
on modern architectures,
that the lack of safe validity checking
is far too high a price to pay
for the difference in speed.

@node LHS Terminals
@section LHS terminals

Marpa's idea
in losing the sharp division between terminals
and non-terminals is that the distinction,
while helpful for proving theorems,
is not essential in practice.
LHS symbols
in the input might be useful for
``short circuiting'' the rules in which they occur.
This may
prove helpful in debugging, or have other applications.

However,
it also can be useful,
for checking input validity as well as for efficiency,
to follow tradition and distinguish
non-terminals from terminals.
For this reason,
the traditional behavior is the default
in Libmarpa.

@node Trap representations
@section Trap representations

In order to be C89 conformant, an application
must initialize all locations that might be read.
This is because C89 allows
@dfindex trap representations
@dfn{trap representations}.

A trap representation is a byte pattern in memory
that is not a valid value of some object type.
When read, the trap representation causes undefined behavior
according to the C89 standard,
making the application that allowed the read non-conformant
to the C89 standard.
Trap representations are carefully defined and discussed in the C99 standard.

In real life, trap representations can occur when floating point values are
used: Some byte patterns that can occur in memory are not valid floating point
values, and can cause undefined behavior when read.

Pointers raise the same issue although,
since it can be safely read as an integer,
some insist that an invalid pointer is not,
strictly speaking, a trap representation.
But there is no portable c89-conformant way of
testing the integer form of a pointer for validity,
so that the only way to guarantee C89 conformance
is to initialize the pointer, either to a valid pointer,
or to a known and therefore testable value, such as @code{NULL}.

All this implies that, in order to claim c89-conformance,
an application must initialize all locations that might be read
to non-trap values.
For a stack implementation, this means that, as a practical matter,
all locations on the stack must be initialized.

@node Advanced input models
@chapter Advanced input models

In an earlier chapter, we introduced Libmarpa's concept of input,
and described its basic input models.
@xref{Input}.
In this chapter we describe Libmarpa's advanced models of input.
These advanced input models have attracted considerable interest.
However, they have seen little actual use so far,
and for that reason we delayed their consideration until now.

A Libmarpa input model is
@dfindex advanced input model
@dfindex input model, advanced
@dfn{advanced}
if it allows tokens of length other than 1.
The advanced input models are also called
@dfindex variable-length token input model
@dfindex input model, variable-length token
@dfn{variable-length token models}
because they allow the token
length to vary from the ``normal'' length of 1.

@node The dense variable-length token model
@section The dense variable-length token model

In the
@dfindex dense variable-length input model
@dfindex variable-length input model, dense
@dfindex input model, dense variable-length
@dfn{dense variable-length model of input},
one or more successful
calls of
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
must be immediately previous
to every call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
Note that,
for a variable-length input model to be ``dense''
according to this definition,
at least one successful call
of @code{marpa_r_alternative()}
must be immediately previous to each call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
Recall that, in this document, we say that a @code{marpa_r_alternative()} call is
``immediately previous'' to a
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call
iff
that @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call is
the first
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} call after
the @code{marpa_r_alternative()} call.

In the dense model of input,
after a successful call of
@code{marpa_r_alternative()},
the earleme variables are as follows:
@itemize
@item
The furthest earleme will be
@code{max(@var{old_f}, @var{old_c}+@var{length})},
    @itemize
    @item where @var{old_f} is the furthest earleme
        before the call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()},
    @item @var{old_c} is the value of the current earleme
        before the call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}, and
    @item @var{length} is the length of the token read.
    @end itemize
@item
@code{marpa_r_alternative()} never changes the
latest or current earleme.
@end itemize

In the dense variable-length model of input,
the effect of the
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
mutator on the earleme variables
is the same as for the
basic models of input.
@xref{The standard model of input}.

In the dense model of input,
the latest earleme is always the same as
the current earleme.
In fact,
the latest earleme and the current earleme
are always the same,
except in the fully general model of input.

@node The fully general input model
@section The fully general input model

In the
@dfindex sparse variable-length input model
@dfindex variable-length input model, sparse
@dfindex input model, sparse variable-length
@dfn{sparse variable-length model of input},
zero or more successful
calls of
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}
must be immediately previous
to every call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
The sparse model is the dense variable-length model,
with its only restriction lifted ---
the sparse variable-length input model
allows calls to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
that are not immediately preceded by calls to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}.

Since it is unrestricted, the sparse input model
is Libmarpa's fully general input model.
Because of this,
it may be useful for us
to state the effect of mutators
on the earleme variables in detail,
even at the expense of some repetition.

In the sparse input model,
@dfindex empty earleme
@dfindex earleme, empty
@dfn{empty earlemes}
are now possible.
An empty earleme is an earleme
with no tokens and no Earley set.
An empty earleme occurs iff
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
is called when there is no immediately previous
call to
@code{marpa_r_alternative()}.
The sparse model takes its name
from the fact that there may be earlemes with no
Earley set.
In the sparse model, Earley sets are ``sparsely''
distributed among the earlemes.

In the dense model of input,
the effect on the earleme variables of
a successful call of the
@code{marpa_r_alternative()} mutator
is the same as for the sparse model of input:
@itemize
@item
The furthest earleme will be
@code{max(@var{old_f}, @var{old_c}+@var{length})},
    @itemize
    @item where @var{old_f} is the furthest earleme
        before the call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()},
    @item @var{old_c} is the value of the current earleme
        before the call to @code{marpa_r_alternative()}, and
    @item @var{length} is the length of the token read.
    @end itemize
@item
@code{marpa_r_alternative()} never changes the
latest or current earleme.
@end itemize

In the sparse model,
when the earleme is not empty,
the effect of
a call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
on the earleme variables is the same as
in the dense and the basic models of input.
Specifically, the following will be true:
@itemize
@item The current earleme will be advanced to @code{@var{old_c}+1},
where @var{old_c} is the current earleme before the call.
@item The latest earleme will be @code{@var{old_c}+1}, and therefore
will be equal to the current earleme.
@item The value of the furthest earleme is never changed by
a call to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
@end itemize

Recall that, in the dense and basic input models,
as a matter of definition,
there are no empty earlemes.
For the sparse input model,
in the case of an empty earleme,
the effect of the
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
mutator on the earleme variables
is the following:
@itemize
@item The current earleme will be advanced to @code{@var{old_c}+1},
where @var{old_c} is the current earleme before the call.
@item The latest earleme will remain at @var{old_l},
where the latest earleme before the call is @var{old_l}.
This implies that the latest earleme will be less than
the current earleme.
@item
The furthest earleme is never changed by a call
to
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}.
@end itemize

After a call to @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
for an empty earleme,
the lastest and current earlemes will have different values.
In a  parse that never calls @code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()}
for an empty earleme,
the lastest and current earlemes will always be the same.

@node Futures
@chapter Futures

This chapter discusses features that are @strong{not}
in the external interface.
These features are change or additions that might be made
to the external interface in the future.

@node Simpler events interface
@section Simpler events interface

Some of the events interfaces are unnecessarily
complex.
Activation in the grammar is unnecessary,
as is the ability to "unmark" an event
for a symbol
before precomputation.
@xref{Completion events},
@pxref{Symbol nulled events}, and
@pxref{Prediction events}.

@node Better defined ambiguity metric
@section Better defined ambiguity metric

With experience, we are now in a position to define an
ambiguity metric that can be cheaply calculated,
and that might be of real use.
Preliminary notes are in the CWeb code.

@node Report item traverser should be a time object
@section Report item traverser should be a time object

Right now, a report item traverser is a kind of "subobject"
of a recognizer.
It should be made into a full-fledged time object.
This will allow multiple report item traversers to be in
use at once,
allowing more aggressive use of this facility.

@node Orthogonal treatment of soft failures
@section Orthogonal treatment of soft failures

The treatment of soft failure evolved along with this interface,
leaving traces of that evolution in the interface.
For example, soft failures should not set the error code,
but soft failure in
@code{marpa_r_progress_item()}
sets the error code to @code{MARPA_ERR_PROGRESS_REPORT_EXHAUSTED}.
@xref{marpa_r_progress_item,marpa_r_progress_item()}.
Similar, soft failure
@code{marpa_t_next()}
sets the error code to @code{MARPA_ERR_TREE_EXHAUSTED}.
These non-orthogonalities should be fixed someday.

@node Orthogonal treatment of exhaustion
@section Orthogonal treatment of exhaustion

The treatment of parse exhaustion is very awkward.
@code{marpa_r_start_input()} returns success on exhaustion,
while
@code{marpa_r_earleme_complete()} either returns success or
a hard failure, depending on circumstances.
@xref{marpa_r_earleme_complete,marpa_r_earleme_complete()}, and
@ref{marpa_r_start_input,marpa_r_start_input()}.

Ideally the treatment should be simpler, more intuitive
and more orthogonal.
Better, perhaps, would be to always treat parse exhaustion
as a soft failure.

@node Furthest earleme values
@section Furthest earleme values

@code{marpa_r_furthest_earleme} returns
@code{unsigned int}, which is non-orthogonal with
@code{marpa_r_current_earleme}.
This leaves no room for an failure return value,
which we deal with by not checking for failures.
The only important potential failure is calling
@code{marpa_r_furthest_earleme} when the furthest
earleme is an indeterminate value.
We eliminate this potential cause of failure by
regarding furthest earleme as having
been initialized when the recognizer was created,
which is another non-orthogonality with
@code{marpa_r_current_earleme}.

All this might be fine, if something were gained, but in fact in the furthest
earleme, unless there is a problem, always becomes the current earleme,
and no use cases for extremely long variable-length tokens are envisioned,
so that the two should never be far apart.
Additionally, the additional values for the furthest earleme only come into
play if the parse is to large for the computer memories as of this writing.
Summarizing, @code{marpa_r_furthest_earleme},
should return an @code{int},
like @code{marpa_r_current_earleme},
and the non-orthogonalities should be eliminated.

@node Additional recoverable failures in marpa_r_alternative()
@section Additional recoverable failures in marpa_r_alternative()

Among the hard failures that
marpa_r_alternative() returns
are the error codes
@code{MARPA_ERR_DUPLICATE_TOKEN},
@code{MARPA_ERR_NO_TOKEN_EXPECTED_HERE}
and @code{MARPA_ERR_INACCESSIBLE_TOKEN}.
These are currently irrecoverable.
They may in fact be fully recoverable,
but are not documented as such because this has not been
tested.

At this writing,
we know of no applications that
attempt to recover from these errors.
It is possible that
these error codes may also be useable for the
techniques similar to the Ruby Slippers,
as of this writing, we know of no proposals
to use them in this way.

These methods, respectively, set
and query the default rank of the grammar.
When a grammar is created, the default rank is 0.
When rules and symbols are created, their rank is
the default rank of the grammar.

Changing the grammar's default rank does not affect
those
rules and symbols already created,
only those that will be created.
This means that
the grammar's default rank can be used to,
in effect, assign ranks to groups of rules and symbols.
Applications may find this behavior useful.

Return value: On success, returns
the rank @strong{after}
the call,
and sets the error code to
@code{MARPA_ERR_NONE}.
On failure, returns @minus{}2,
and sets the error code to an appropriate
value, which will never be
@code{MARPA_ERR_NONE}.
Note that when the rank is @minus{}2,
the error code is the only way to distinguish
success from failure.
The error code can be determined by using the

@node Valued and unvalued symbols
@section Valued and unvalued symbols

@node What unvalued symbols were
@subsection What unvalued symbols were

Libmarpa symbols can have values,
which is the traditional way of doing semantics.
Libmarpa also allows symbols to be unvalued.
An
@dfindex unvalued symbol
@dfindex symbol, unvalued
@dfn{unvalued}
symbol is one whose value
is unpredictable from instance to instance.
If a symbol is unvalued, we sometimes say that it
has ``whatever'' semantics.

Situations where the semantics can tolerate unvalued symbols
are surprisingly frequent.
For example, the top-level of many languages is a series
of major units, all of whose semantics are typically accomplished
via side effects.
The compiler is typically indifferent to the actual value produced
by these major units, and tracking them is a waste of time.
Similarly, the value of the separators in a list is typically
ignored.

Rules are unvalued if and only if their LHS symbols
are unvalued.
When rules and symbols are unvalued,
Libmarpa optimizes their evaluation.

It is in principle unsafe to check the value
of a symbol if it can be unvalued.
For this reason,
once a symbol has been treated as valued,
Libmarpa marks it as valued.
Similarly,
once a symbol has been treated as unvalued,
Libmarpa marks it as unvalued.
Once marked, a symbol's valued status is
@dfindex locked value status (of a symbol)
@dfindex value status, locked (of a symbol)
@dfn{locked}
and cannot be changed later.

The valued status of terminals is marked the first
time they are read.
The valued status of LHS symbols must be explicitly
marked by the application when initializing the
valuator --- this is Libmarpa's equivalent of
registering a callback.

LHS terminals are disabled by default.
If allowed, the user should be aware that the valued
status of a LHS terminal
will be locked in the recognizer
if it is used as a terminal,
and the symbol's use as a rule LHS
in the valuator must be
consistent with the recognizer's marking.

Marpa reports an error when a symbol's use
conflicts with its locked valued status.
Doing so usually saves the Libmarpa user
some tricky debugging further down the road.

@node Grammar methods dealing with unvalued symbols
@subsection Grammar methods dealing with unvalued symbols

@deftypefunx int marpa_g_symbol_is_valued ( @
    Marpa_Grammar @var{g}, @

These methods, respectively, set
and query the ``valued status'' of a symbol.
Once set to a value with the
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_valued_set()}
method,
the valued status of a symbol is ``locked'' at that value.
It cannot thereafter be changed.
Subsequent calls to
@code{marpa_g_symbol_is_valued_set()}
for the same @var{sym_id} will fail,
leaving @var{sym_id}'s valued status unchanged,
unless @var{value} is the same as the locked-in value.

Return value: On success, 1 if the symbol @var{symbol_id}
is valued after the call, 0 if not.
If the valued status is locked and @var{value}
is different from the current status, @minus{}2.
If @var{value} is not 0 or 1;
or on other failure, @minus{}2.

@node Registering semantics in the valuator
@subsection Registering semantics in the valuator

By default, Libmarpa's valuator objects
assume that
non-terminal symbols have
no semantics.
The archetypal application will need to register
symbols that contain semantics.
The primary method for doing this is
@code{marpa_v_symbol_is_valued()}.
Applications will typically register semantics by rule,
and these applications will find
the
@code{marpa_v_rule_is_valued()}
method more convenient.

@anchor{marpa_v_symbol_is_valued_set}
@deftypefun int marpa_v_symbol_is_valued_set ( @

@deftypefunx int marpa_v_symbol_is_valued ( @
    Marpa_Value @var{v}, @
    Marpa_Symbol_ID @var{sym_id} )

These methods, respectively,
set and query
the valued status of symbol @var{sym_id}.
@code{marpa_v_symbol_is_valued_set()}
will set
the valued status to
the value of
its @var{status} argument.
A valued status of 1 indicates that the symbol is valued.
A valued status of 0 indicates that the symbol is unvalued.
If the valued status is locked,
an attempt to change to a status different from the
current one will fail
(error code @code{MARPA_ERR_VALUED_IS_LOCKED}).

Return value:  On success, the valued status @strong{after}
the call.
If @var{value} is not either 0 or 1,
or on other failure, @minus{}2.
@end deftypefun

@anchor{marpa_v_rule_is_valued_set}
@deftypefun int marpa_v_rule_is_valued_set ( @
    Marpa_Value @var{v}, @

@anchor{marpa_v_rule_is_valued}
@deftypefunx int marpa_v_rule_is_valued ( @
    Marpa_Value @var{v}, @
    Marpa_Rule_ID @var{rule_id} )

These methods, respectively,
set and query
the valued status
for the LHS symbol of rule @var{rule_id}.
@code{marpa_v_rule_is_valued_set()}
sets
the valued status to the value
of its @var{status} argument.

A valued status of 1 indicates that the symbol is valued.
A valued status of 0 indicates that the symbol is unvalued.
If the valued status is locked,
an attempt to change to a status different from the
current one will fail
(error code @code{MARPA_ERR_VALUED_IS_LOCKED}).

Rules have no valued status of their own.
The valued status of a rule
is always that of its LHS symbol.
These methods are conveniences --- they
save the application the trouble of looking
up the rule's LHS.

Return value:  On success, the valued status of the
rule @var{rule_id}'s LHS symbol @strong{after}
the call.
If @var{value} is not either 0 or 1,
or on other failure, @minus{}2.
@end deftypefun

@anchor{marpa_v_valued_force}
@deftypefun int marpa_v_valued_force ( @

This methods locks the valued status of all symbols
to 1, indicated that the symbol is valued.
If this is not possible, for example because one of
the grammar's symbols already is locked at a valued
status of 0,
failure is returned.

Return value: On success, a non-negative number.
On failure, returns @minus{}2,
and sets the error code to an appropriate
value, which will never be
@code{MARPA_ERR_NONE}.
