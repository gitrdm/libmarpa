# Acknowledgments

This section is to thank those who have assisted us,
not just with this repository,
but with the Marpa project as a whole.
Many people have helped us in many ways,
and it is risky
to single out one of them.
But, from almost its beginning,
Ron Savage has been unstinting in
his support.

Jean-Damien Durand's assistance included several ambitious
Marpa applications.
Deyan Ginev provided advice on LaTeX and
on deeper matters which proved essential for this book.
Lenz Moritz quietly and effectively maintained our IRC channel.
Andrew Rodland stood in for Jeffrey Kegler as the face of Marpa
when it was needed,
and he pioneered the use of one Marpa grammar
to feed another.
Ruslan Shvedov provided many hours of assistance,
ranging from linguistic insights to details of code testing.
Luc St-Louis moderated the Marpa IRC channel,
saving Jeffrey time,
and the channel's other users from having to put up with Jeffrey,
who could be too heavy-handed,
as a moderator.
Peter Stuifzand wrote the prototype on which Marpa's
SLIF interface is based.
Ruslan Zakirov was a very early Marpa supporter
who made many useful suggestions
that are incorporated in this book.
Larry Wall has always made himself available,
and his wise and experienced advice saved us much trouble.
An anonymous member of the Hoon community was generous
financially.

Additional help came from
Dave Abrahams,
Mohammad S Anwar,
Lukas Atkinson,
Peter Blackson,
Domingo Alvarez Duarte,
Anton Dyudin,
B. Fraser,
Zaki Mughal,
Omar Roth,
Arsen Shnurkov,
Aria Stewart,
Flaviu Tomas,
and David Whitten.

## Acks from Marpa::R2

```
I'm grateful to Randal Schwartz for his support over the years that
I've been working on Marpa.
My chats with
Larry Wall have been few and brief,
but his openness to new ideas has been
a major encouragement
and his insight into the relationship between
"natural language" and computer language
has been a major influence.
More recently,
Allison Randal and Patrick Michaud have been generous with their
very valuable time.
They might have preferred that I volunteered as a Parrot cage-cleaner,
but if so, they were too polite to say.

Many at perlmonks.org answered questions for me.
I used answers from
chromatic, Corion, dragonchild,
jdporter, samtregar and Juerd,
among others,
in writing this module.
I'm just as grateful to those whose answers I didn't use.
My inquiries were made while I was thinking out the code and
it wasn't always 100% clear what I was after.
If the butt is moved after the round,
it shouldn't count against the archer.

In writing the Pure Perl version of Marpa, I benefited from studying
the work of Francois Desarmenien (C<Parse::Yapp>),
Damian Conway (C<Parse::RecDescent>) and
Graham Barr (C<Scalar::Util>).
Adam Kennedy patiently instructed me
in module writing,
both on the finer points and
on issues about which I really should have known better.

I am very grateful to a handful of early contributors,
whose contributions were made when I desperately needed help.
I am especially grateful to Ron Savage,
who has been a very aggressive early adopter
of all Marpa's versions.
Ruslan Zakirov generously
started, and agreed to moderate,
the "Marpa parser" mailing list.
Peter Stuifzand invented the "Stuifzand interface",
which was the original inspiration for the SLIF.

Ron, Peter and Ruslan Z. have since gone on to contribute
in ways too numerous to mention,
and others have joined in.
Jean-Damien Durand's numerous contributions include
the Windows port of Marpa.
Ruslan Shvedov helped with ASF's
and my documentation.
Andrew Rodland's TAP parser, with one Marpa grammar layered on
another, was another major inspiration
for the SLIF.

Finally, my thanks to all those who participated on
the "Marpa parser" mailing list.
It is hard to describe how important
informed and constructive feedback
is to a lone laborer on
a complex and large project like Marpa,
and I greatly appreciate all the
contributors to the list.

## An apology

We feared that these acknowledgements would
become an exhibition of our negligence and ingratitude,
and at least to some degree this has turned out to be the case.
But we assure the reader,
despite appearances,
there were plans for it to be otherwise.
We took care to thank those who helped us
in Marpa's IRC channel,
expecting to use its backlog
as a source for this chapter.

However, in 2018, the European Union (EU),
via its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
suddenly brought these plans to nought.
Under the GDPR,
logs like that for Marpa's IRC channel could not possibly be made
conformant in a way that kept their administrators safe from
legal action.
In theory this applied to similar, highly-profitable databases maintained
by large corporations,
as much as it did to the volunteers
generously maintaining the backlog for our IRC channel.
In practice large corporations have been able to largely neutralize the GDPR,
deftly parrying most enforcement,
with their worst possible outcome being a cost-of-doing-business fine.
For the typical volunteer, however, even winning a legal action is ruinous,
given the costs.

Whether or not some were aware of
GDPR's highly discriminatory effects
when it was being drafted,
the realization of the GDPR's practical implications
for volunteer-driven open source effort
came to that community very abruptly,
and after it was already in effect.
Our backlogging was done in EU jurisdiction,
and no measure to save our IRC backlogs
could be taken
without exposing innocent and generous volunteers
to ruinous legal action.
And my notes for these acknkowledgements
needed to be cobbled together from other sources.
