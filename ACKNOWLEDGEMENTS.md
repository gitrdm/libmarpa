# Acknowledgments

> Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you;

This section thanks those who have helped,
not just with this repository,
but with the Marpa project as a whole.
We feared that these acknowledgements would
become an exhibition of our negligence and ingratitude,
and at least to some degree this has turned out to be the case.
But we assure the reader,
despite appearances,
there were plans for it to be otherwise.
We took care to thank those who helped us
in Marpa's IRC channel,
expecting to use its backlog
as a source for this chapter.

However, in 2018, the European Union (EU),
via its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
suddenly brought these plans to nought.
Under the GDPR,
logs like that for Marpa's IRC channel could not possibly be made
conformant in a way that kept their administrators safe from
legal action.
In theory this applied to similar, highly-profitable databases maintained
by large corporations,
as much as it did to the volunteers
generously maintaining the backlog for our IRC channel.
In practice large corporations have been able to largely neutralize the GDPR,
deftly parrying most enforcement,
with their worst possible outcome being a cost-of-doing-business fine.
For the typical volunteer, however, even winning a legal action is ruinous,
given the costs.

Whether or not some were aware of
GDPR's highly discriminatory effects
when it was being drafted,
the realization of the GDPR's practical implications
for volunteer-driven open source effort
came to that community very abruptly,
and after it was already in effect.
Our backlogging was done in EU jurisdiction,
and no measure to save our IRC backlogs
could be taken
without exposing innocent and generous volunteers
to ruinous legal action.
And my notes for these acknkowledgements
needed to be cobbled together from other sources.

But, to proceed to business:
Many members of the Marpa community
have helped me in many ways,
and it is risky
to single out one of them.
But, from almost its beginning,
Ron Savage has been unstinting in
his support.

Jean-Damien Durand's assistance included several ambitious
Marpa applications.
Deyan Ginev provided advice on LaTeX and
on deeper matters which proved essential for this book.
Lenz Moritz quietly and effectively maintained our IRC channel.
Andrew Rodland stood in for me as the face of Marpa,
and he pioneered the use of one Marpa grammar
to feed another.
Ruslan Shvedov provided many hours of assistance,
ranging from linguistic insights to details of code testing.
Luc St-Louis moderated the Marpa IRC channel,
saving me time,
and the channel's other users from having to put up with
my less than fully competent,
and often too heavy-handed efforts.
Peter Stuifzand wrote the prototype on which Marpa's
SLIF interface is based.
Ruslan Zakirov was a very early Marpa supporter
who made many useful suggestions
that are incorporated in this book.
Larry Wall has always made himself available,
and his wise and experienced advice saved us much trouble.
An anonymous member of the Hoon community was generous
financially.
