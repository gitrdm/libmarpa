    and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny.}

While we always feared that this section would
be an exhibition of our negligence and ingratitude as anything else,
there had been plans for it to be otherwise.
We took care to thank those who helped us
in \Marpa's IRC channel,
expecting to use its backlog
as a source for this chapter.

In 2018, the European Union (EU),
via its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),
suddenly brought these plans to nought.
Under the GDPR,
logs like that for \Marpa's IRC channel could not possibly be made
conformant in a way that kept their administrators safe from
legal action.
In theory this applied to similar, highly-profitable databases maintained
by large corporations,
as much as it did to the volunteers
generously maintaining the backlog for our IRC channel.
In practice large corporations have been able to largely neutralize the GDPR,
deftly parrying most enforcement,
with their worst possible outcome being a cost-of-doing-business fine.
For the typical volunteer, however, even winning a legal action is ruinous,
given the costs.

Whether or not some were aware of
GDPR's highly discriminatory effects
when it was being drafted,
realization of the GDPR's practical implications
for ourselves
came to the open source community very abruptly,
and after it was already in effect.
Our backlogging was done in EU jurisdiction,
and no measure to save our IRC backlogs
could be taken
without inviting legal action.

Many members of the \Marpa community
have helped me in many ways,
and it is risky
to single out one of them.
But, from almost its beginning,
Ron Savage has been unstinting in
his support.

Jean-Damien Durand's assistance included several ambitious
\Marpa applications.
Deyan Ginev provided advice on \LaTeX{} and
on deeper matters which proved essential for this book.
Lenz Moritz quietly and effectively maintained our IRC channel.
Andrew Rodland stood in for me as the face of \Marpa,
and he pioneered the use of one \Marpa grammar
to feed another.
Ruslan Shvedov provided many hours of assistance,
ranging from linguistic insights to details of code testing.
Luc St-Louis moderated the \Marpa IRC channel,
saving me time,
and the channel's other users from having to put up with
my less than fully competent,
and often too heavy-handed efforts.
Peter Stuifzand wrote the prototype on which \Marpa's
SLIF interface is based.
Ruslan Zakirov was a very early \Marpa supporter
who made many useful suggestions
that are incorporated in this book.
Larry Wall has always made himself available,
and his wise and experienced advice saved us much trouble.
An anonymous member of the Hoon community was generous
financially.
